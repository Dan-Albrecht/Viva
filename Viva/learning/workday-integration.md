# Configure Workday in Microsoft Viva Learning

This document outlines how to configure Workday as a content source in Microsoft Viva Learning. The integration is based on Workday RaaS APIs (Report as a Service). Integration supports catalog, assignment, and completions data from Workday. Catalog covers Blended Courses, Digital courses, Lesson, Program, and External provider integrated on Workday.

> [!NOTE]
> Catalog, assignments, and completion data are retrieved using RaaS (REST APIs). Thumbnails for Workday hosted content is retrieved using SOAP APIs, while thumbnails for third party content configured on Workday are retrieved using the RaaS report. The Workday-hosted thumbnails are stored in Viva Learning as metadata.

## Prerequisites

You need the following permissions and scenarios in place to complete the Workday configuration process:

- Viva Learning Admin access
- Workday Admin access, 
- User mapping between Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) and Workday should be in place (check the RaaS report creation section for more details).
-  Workday Web Service Endpoint & RaaS reports are available for Viva Learning integration with no inhibition by any network or firewall policies.


## Configuration to enable Workday integration

The workday integration process consists of three primary steps:

1. Create an Integration System User (ISU) account and assign required security access in Workday.
2. Create four RaaS reports for catalog, user, assignment or assignment completion, and self-enrollment completion data.
3. Once all configuration parameters are generated on Workday, you can configure Workday in the Viva Learning admin portal.



## Create an integration system user (ISU) on the Workday portal and assign required security access

Integration system user (ISU) account is required for Microsoft Viva Learning to access your Workday tenant. ISU can be created from Workday portal. ISU also requires relevant security group access with permission to access Workday Learning Web Services and learning catalog.

1. Access the **Create Integration System User** task. Workday automatically sets the value of **Session Timeout Minutes** to zero to prevent the integration system user session from expiring. Expired sessions can cause the integration to stop before it successfully completes.

2. Create a username and password. Workday recommends using **ISU_Microsoft_Viva_Learning** for the username. **Note:** The username can be customized.

![Screenshot of the menu of Create Integration System User with account information fields.](/viva/media/learning/wd-s1-1-create-integration-system-user.png)
3. Access the **Create Security Group** task and select **Integration System Security Group (Unconstrained)**.
4. Provide a group name. Workday recommends using **ISU_Microsoft_Viva_Learning**. It doesn’t need to be the same as the ISU name. 
    ![Screenshot of the type of tenanted security group and name fields](/viva/media/learning/wd-s1-2-create-security-group.png)
5. Link your group to the integration system user. This lets Workday assign the integration system user as part of the Microsoft Viva Learning security group.
    ![Screenshot of the Edit Integration System Security Group fields. ](/viva/media/learning/wd-s1-3-edit-integration-system.png)
6. You need these domains in the Integration and System functional areas: Integration Security, security Configuration. Access the **Maintain Permissions for Security Group** task to update domain security policies.
![Screenshot of the MAintain Permissions window with a Source Security Group added.](/viva/media/learning/wd-s1-4-security-group-permissions.png)
![Screenshot of the Security Group permissions with completed fields.](/viva/media/learning/wd-s1-5-security-group-permissions.png)
7. In Domain Security Policy Permission, add **Get Only** access to the following domain security policies.

| Domain security policy | Description |
|-----| ----- |
| Reports: Learning Record  | This domain provides access to reports that display data related to the learning record. This permission is required for accessing RaaS report for Assignment and completion sync. |
| Manage: Learning Content | This domain provides access to certain administrative tasks to manage learning content. This permission is required for accessing RaaS report for catalog sync. |
| Worker Data: Active and Terminated Workers | This domain provides access to reporting fields and data sources that include terminated workers. This domain policy is required for certain fields (Firstname, lastname, email address, ID) in User RaaS report.  |
| Worker Data: Current staffing information | Provides information on workers' current information such as status, length of service, seniority. Includes web services. This domain policy is required for certain fields (Worker is Terminated) in User RaaS report. |
| Workday Accounts | This domain provides access to the management of Workday Accounts. This domain policy is required for certain fields (username) in User RaaS report. |


![Screenshot of the maintain permissions for security group screen.](../media/learning/workday-maintain-permissions-security-group.png)

8. Run the **Activate Pending Security Policy Changes** task.
9. **Advance security**: These are **optional** steps for advance security access on ISU.

    1. **Optional**: **Set up course-segmented security on Workday portal**:
    You can configure which learning content displays in Viva Learning by restricting the integration system user's access by using segmented security. You can segment security based on security categories or topics.

        1. Access the **Create Learning Security Category** task or the **Create Learning Topic** task. Create security segments or topics to restrict access and add these to your learning content. You need the Learning Segment Setup domain in the System functional area.
        Select the Inactive checkbox if you want to disable permissions for members of the security group. You can't inactivate the security group when you:
            - Grant the security group permission to the Security Configuration domain.
            - Include the security group as a member of another security group.
            - Specify the security group as an administrator for another security group.

        1. From the **Security Groups** prompt, select security groups to identify who has permission to access the securable content.
        1. From the **Access to Segments** prompt, select security segments that you want members of the specified security groups to be able to access. Workday-owned security groups include:
            - Job Application - Contingent Worker
            - Job Application – Employee
            - Job Application – External
        1. You can't combine different types of security segments in a segment-based security group.

            **Example scenario:** You want a Benefits Administrator to be able to manage only benefits-related documents. You don't want them to be able to manage payroll-related documents. Workday secures access to manage all worker documents to the Worker Data: Add Worker Documents and Worker Data: Edit and Delete Worker Documents domains.
            You can create **Document Categories** - Benefits segment to identify benefits-related documents. You can then use the security segment to create a segment-based security group so Benefits Administrators can access only the benefits-related documents. 

        1. Next steps:  Users with access to a domain through both a segment-based and a non-segment-based security group have permission to access all segments. Make sure you associate non-segment-based security groups with users who have permission to access all segments by:
            - Reviewing all security groups on the policy before adding segment-based security groups. 
            - Reviewing the included security groups in an aggregation security group.
        1. To provide security permissions: 
            - Add the security group to security policies. 
            - Activate pending security policy changes. 
            - Activate the security group when you want to enable the permissions on an inactive security group. 


    2. **Optional:** Edit domain security policies on Workday portal. You can configure which security groups have permission to access the secured items in a domain. You need the Security Configuration domain in the System functional area.
        1. Access the **Domain Security Policies for Functional Area** report.
        2. Select a security policy.
        3. Select **Edit Permissions**.
        4. Select the **View** or **Modify** checkbox to grant the security groups access to the report or task securable items.
        5. Select the **Get** or **Put** checkbox to grant the security groups access to integration and report or task securable actions.
    3. Activate pending security policy changes on Workday portal.
        Create an active timestamp using the **Activate Pending Security Policy Changes** task. Security policy changes made since the previous active timestamp take effect immediately. The active timestamp now reflects the current time, regardless of pending changes. You can run these reports to view a detailed list of the security policy changes you’re activating: Domain security policies with pending changes, Business process security policies with pending changes.

        1. Access the **Activate Pending Security Policy Changes** task.

        1. Describe your changes in the **Comment** field.
        1. Check the **Confirm** checkbox to activate your changes.
        1. You can use the **View All Security Timestamps** report to roll back to a previous timestamp.

## Create RaaS reports for catalog, user, assignment, and completion data

This section consists of steps required for enabling catalog, user, assignment, and completion data sync in Workday and Viva Learning integration. 
Admins are required to create a custom RaaS report on the Workday portal. Once you have created integration system user of Workday portal and have provided all security access, follow these steps to create the required RaaS reports.  


> [!NOTE]
> All RaaS reports (catalog, user data, LRS) should be created from same user account or a single user should be given report ownership at Workday portal. This username should be inserted under Reporting URL attribute in Viva Learning Manage Provider. Review this example: `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/microsoft_dpt6/username/Viva_Learning_Catalog_Report.`

> [!NOTE]
> Admins need to create a custom report manually. This is a one time process. We are only supporting the report structure mentioned in this support article, any other changes in reports are not recommended.

1. Ensure that the **Workday to AAD user sync** is in place for your tenant.  
Enable inbound user provisioning with Workday to ensure that all users in Workday are synced to Azure Active Directory (AAD).
If you're already a Microsoft 365 customer, Workday to AAD user sync should be in place for your tenant. Check with your organization admins for details around same. Otherwise, you can refer to the steps mentioned here to enable the provisioning. [Tutorial: Configure Workday for automatic user provisioning with on-premises Active Directory](/entra/identity/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial)

## Generate connection parameters in Workday portal

This section outlines how to generate connection parameters on your Workday portal.

### Retrieve the Workday Web Service endpoint

You can find the required Workday Web Service endpoint on the Workday Data Centers page on Community.

1. Use the Workday [resource page](https://resourcecenter.workday.com) to identify which Workday Production Data Center your tenant is in.

1. Now that you know your data center, fill in your information inside the {brackets} to get your URL. You need this URL for integration in your Microsoft 365 admin center. `https:// {**Production Data Center URL Prefix**}/ccx/service/{**Tenant name**}/Learning/v39.2`
 
An example of a URL: `https://wd3.myworkday.com/ccx/service/yourorg/Learning/v39.2`

### Enable OAuth for Workday, generate Client ID, client secret and refresh token

To enhance the security and maintain the integration, we have enabled OAuth for Workday.

This avoids dependency from ISU’s username and password and handles the scenario if ISU leaves the company. Refer to below steps to generate client ID and Client secret required for configuration on admin portal. 
OAuth access is applied at client level, so it will not impact any other sign in flow of other clients linked to Workday. To know more about OAuth, you can refer to [Workday’s OAuth documentation.](https://resourcecenter.workday.com/en-us/signin.html?fromURI=https://signin.resourcecenter.workday.com/app/workdayciam_aembetadoc2_1/exkd1j067lBdQMGYl4x7/sso/saml)

1. Enable OAuth for the tenant 
    1. Access the **Edit Tenant Setup - Security** task. 
    2. Scroll down, in the **OAuth 2.0 Settings section**, select the **OAuth 2.0 Clients Enabled** check box.
    
    ![Screenshot of the OAuth 2.0 Clients Enabled checkbox selected.](/viva/media/learning/wd-s3-1.png)

1. Create the client for OAuth. 
1. Search for **Register API client for integrations** task. Enter client name as "VivaLearning" and set expiry of refresh token as "Never" and Scope (Functional Areas) the following. To edit any existing OAuth settings, you can use the **view API client for integrations** action.

    - "Organizations and Roles”
    - “Learning core”
    - “Staffing”
    - “System”
    - “Tenant nonconfigurable”  

    ![Screenshot of the Register API Client for Integrations](/viva/media/learning/wd-s3-2.png)

4. After creation of API client for integration, you'll get the ClientID and client Secret. Copy the client ID and client secret. This is used on admin portal.

5. Generate refresh token 
    1. Search for task- "View API client", go to tab “API clients for integration”. It shows all clients. Open the "VivaLearning" client created in previous step. 
    1. Select the ellipses (...), then **API client** and **Manage Refresh Token for Integration**. 
    
    ![Screenshot of the View API Client with the option task to manage refresh tokens for integration](/viva/media/learning/wd-s3-3.png)
