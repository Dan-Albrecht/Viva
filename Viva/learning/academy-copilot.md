## Language support 

Microsoft Copilot Academy is currently only supported in English with a planned expansion to other languages. 

## Create your own custom academy

You can create a new Academy tailored to your needs by utilizing learning objects from the Copilot Academy. This approach allows you to maintain the essence of the Copilot Academy while also incorporating your organization's unique requirements. Hereâ€™s how: 

- **Create learning paths**: Start by creating learning paths that mirror learning paths available in the Copilot Academy. This step forms the foundation of your custom academy. 

- **Add to your new academy**: Once your learning paths are set, you can seamlessly integrate them into your new academy for a personalized learning experience.
