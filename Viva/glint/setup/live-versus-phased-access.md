# Grant *live* versus *phased* access in Viva Glint reporting

## Choose reporting level access for managers

There are two levels of reporting access in Microsoft Viva Glint:

- **Live access**: Reporting access is readily available, in real time, as surveys are completed. Admins always have *live* access and can't be included in *phased* access rollout.
  
- **Phased access**:  Recommended for managers and HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners) for action planning, tracking, and reviewing feedback results for completed surveys. *Phased* access excludes this role group from real-time, live survey results. *Phased* access is configured at the program level but occurs at the cycle level.

>[!TIP]
>Keep survey results classified while the survey is *live*, among just a small group of leaders. Incomplete results may lead to unintended and inaccurate conclusions. Feedback results aren't final until all results are considered.

## Change from *live* to *phased* access

1. Switch to the **Completed** view and hover over the survey cycle.
2. Select the content in the **Reporting Access** column in that row.
3. The Program Summary page will display, and then Reporting Access.
4. Select **Grant Access**.
5. Check the box of the roles you wish to grant access to. Once access is granted, it can't be revoked.
6. Select **Provide Access**. *Visible to All Reporting Roles and Release Completed* is displayed.

Once the next program cycle begins, and if the last cycle has *phased* access, access defaults back to *live.*
