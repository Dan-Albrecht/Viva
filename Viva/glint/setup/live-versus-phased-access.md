# Grant Live versus Phased access in Viva Glint reporting

## Levels of reporting access

The following are the two levels of reporting access in Microsoft Viva Glint:

- **Live access**: Reporting access is readily available, in real time, as surveys are completed. Admins always have live access and can't be included in phased access rollout.
- **Phased access**:  Recommended for managers and HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners) for action planning, tracking, and reviewing feedback results for completed surveys, excluding this role group from real-time, live survey results. Phased access is configured at the program level but occurs at the cycle level.

## Phased access is recommended for managers

Keeping survey results classified while the survey is live, among just a small group of leaders, is often prudent. Incomplete results may lead to unintended and inaccurate conclusions. Feedback results aren't final until all results have been considered.

## Change from Live access to Phased access

1. Switch to the **Completed** view and hover over the survey cycle.
2. Select the content in the **Reporting Access** column in that row.
3. The Program Summary page will display, and then Reporting Access.
4. Select **Grant Access**.
5. Check the box of the roles you wish to grant access to. Once access is granted, it can't be revoked.
6. Select **Provide Access**. *Visible to All Reporting Roles and Release Completed* is displayed.

Once the next program cycle begins, and if the last cycle has Phased access, the access would default back to Live.
