# Change survey item IDs for expired survey cycles

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The platform feature allowing admins to change survey item ID numbers releases on March 9, 2024.

Comparing survey trend is essential to tracking focus area progress – overall employee engagement - over time. When a survey is retired, you can still use the data for an item from that survey as a comparison in a new survey which uses the identical item by changing the item ID. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The term "survey item" refers to any *question* or *statement* posed to a survey taker. 

## Viewing the survey item ID

You need to know if any items from an expired survey are still being used and then compare their IDs.

There are two ways to view an item ID:

-	From the Question Library feature
  - From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Question Library**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/question-id-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how an item ID is displayed.":::

-	The item ID can also be seen within the *Questions* page in Program Summary.
  - From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
  - Within the survey cycle, navigate to the **Questions** page in *Program Summary*. Select **Edit Question** and a slider window opens.
  - You'll see the *Question ID* above the *Language* section. This ID applies to all active, upcoming, and completed surveys. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Question ID isn't editable for active surveys.

## Editing an expired ID for use in an upcoming cycle

> [!CAUTION]
> Change an ID only if you’ve discovered that survey trends are broken because one or more different items IDs were used in this cycle – this means the question/item is identical, but the ID is not. 


1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.
1. Selected the **Completed surveys** tab and then the **Questions** row to view the questions from that survey.
1. On the *Questions* page, hover over the ellipses to display the dropdown menu. Select **Change Question ID** and a *Change Question ID* dialog box displays.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If your survey items are translated into different languages, export the survey details before proceeding, so you’ll have a record of your translations.

4. Be sure the **Current question type, name and ID** are as expected.
1. Choose an item from the survey program that you want to use from the dropdown box.
1. Select **Change** to commit your selection. 
1. When the dialog box closes, select **Save Changes**. 
1. After these steps are complete, you'll see a *Changes Pending* notification on the item line. 
1. Select **Save**.
