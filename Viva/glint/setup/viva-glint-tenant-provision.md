# Set up a Microsoft Viva Glint tenant

To deploy apps that use the Microsoft platform for identity and access management, you first need access to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) *tenant*. In the Azure AD tenant, you'll register and manage your Viva Glint apps, configure their access to data and other web APIs, and enable features like Conditional Access. 

A tenant represents an organization. It's a dedicated instance of the Azure AD tenant that an organization or app developer receives at the beginning of a relationship with Microsoft. 

Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD tenants. It has its own representation of work and school identities, consumer identities (if it's an Azure AD B2C tenant), and app registrations. An app registration inside your tenant can allow authentications only from accounts within your tenant or all tenants. 

When a new customer purchases Viva Glint, they're entitled to the Viva Glint product, and tenant provisioning should occur within days of the purchase. Customer instances can be hosted on Viva Glint’s US or EU server. 

## Customers entitled for Viva Glint provisioning 

- Net new Viva Glint standalone customers
- Viva Suite customers
- LinkedIn Glint standalone customers
- Existing Viva suite and LinkedIn Glint customer

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A Viva Glint tenant is not available for GCC/GCC H entities as it is intended for commercial services only.
> - A minimum number of 100 active user licenses are required for tenant provisioning. Licenses requested below 100 will prompt a screen message and email to inform you to contact your Microsoft Account Manager or adjust the number of licenses purchased in the Microsoft Admin Center, if you purchased via our self-serve checkout flow. 

## Begin your Viva Glint provisioning experience

Choose either the US or EU URL for Azure login to begin:

- US - [http://app.us1.glint.cloud.microsoft](http://app.us1.glint.cloud.microsoft)
- EU - [http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft](http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft)

>[!TIP]
