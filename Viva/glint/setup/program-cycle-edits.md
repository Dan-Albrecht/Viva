# Understand Viva Glint programs and cycles  

Setting up your first Viva Glint program in the manner suggested is the most efficient way to incorporate Viva Glint into your company’s infrastructure going forward. Much of the setup will be used in your upcoming (future) programs, so taking the time to build your platform and plan ahead is key. 

## Learn our terminology 

**Pulse Program**: A series of surveys, also called a “survey program.” For example, a Quarterly Engagement Survey is a pulse series, with invitations sent out quarterly for each survey.  

**Cycle**: One single survey within a program. 

**Tip**: We use the word “survey” most often when referring to a cycle. This term aligns best for global translation.  

**Linked**: By default, all surveys/cycles are “linked,” meaning that any changes made at the program level will automatically apply to all future surveys in the program.  

**Unlinked**: A single survey can be edited in ways that don't affect future surveys in the same program. When edits are made to a single survey, it becomes “unlinked.” Edits made to an unlinked survey only affect that survey and not future surveys in the same program. Trend data is unaffected. 

## Edit a program vs. a single survey (cycle) 

Once an entire program (pulse) has been set up, future surveys are edited at the program level in the [Program Summary](https://www.microsoft.com/) section of the admin dashboard. For example, if you want to set up a series and avoid major adjustments to each survey, edit at the program level. If untouched, the same survey emails, text, and questions are repeated with each cycle in the program. However, you might choose to edit a single survey, or cycle, in ways that won't affect future cycles in the program. 

>[!TIP]
> Carefully consider edits at the program level which affect all future surveys. 

### The most common single survey editing involves survey emails 

- If a survey is live, and you want to adjust the schedule or add email reminders, then you need to make edits at the cycle level.  
- If you want email communication to be unique to one survey, and you don’t want it to affect emails programmed for subsequent surveys, you can do so at the cycle level.  

For other changes needed to a live survey, read [Make changes to a live Viva Glint survey](https://www.microsoft.com/). 

>[!TIP]
> Between surveys, you can continue to edit email communications at the program level. 

## Edit a live survey schedule or add an email reminder 

A live survey is considered “locked.” To make edits to a survey schedule, editing at the individual cycle level is required.

>[!NOTE]
> The Approved button on that page must be toggled to **YES**.    

1. From your admin dashboard, in **Survey Programs**, navigate to the program name that you want to edit. 
2. Select the **Upcoming and Live** tab. 
3. Select the vertical ellipses next to the survey you edit. 
4. Select **Manage Schedule**.

## What does an “unlinked” survey notification mean? 

Before making edits at the cycle level, a message warns that this cycle will become unlinked meaning that most changes made to the survey text, questions, or email and reminders will affect only this survey - future, linked surveys retain inputs at the program level. 

## Relinking surveys 

If you’ve made edits at the cycle level and your survey is unlinked from the program, several unlinked reminders will be tied to the cycle. 

>[!NOTE]
> - If a survey is live, it cannot be re-linked. However, this will not affect the results outcomes (e.g., reporting trend).
> -  If the survey has already ended, it does not need to be re-linked afterward. 
> - Cycle-level edits will not be retained at the program level for future surveys. Edit both accordingly. 

>[!TIP]
> Make future survey changes at the program level, in between cycles. This will ensure its always clear what text, questions and communications schedule will be associated with the upcoming survey.
