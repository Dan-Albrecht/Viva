# Set up Schedule page in Program Summary

Choose the cadence for your program. This determines your launch date(s) and how often your employees receive this survey.   

## Procedure for setting up Schedule page

1. In the **Surveys should go out every** section, set a number, and then select Weeks or Months using the dropdown arrow.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Survey dates can be edited on a per survey basis, and surveys will have to be manually approved and enabled to be sent out.

   > [!TIP]
   > Consider other survey programs already in place and business processes that might influence your ability to act on the outcomes of the survey in a timely, meaningful manner.


2. Select your target launch date in the **Send the next survey** on section. Dates are displayed in the time zone that your program admin has preselected.
3. Once you select the date for your survey to be sent, a tentative schedule, based on the cadence selected, will appear in **Schedule Preview**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Survey dates can be edited on a per survey basis, and surveys will have to be manually approved and enabled to be sent out.

4. In the **Response Window** section, set the total number of days you're allowing respondents to submit their survey. The survey closes at 11:59 PM on the cycle end date.

   **Best Practices**:

   - For Recurring programs, use a two weeks response window.   
   - For Ad Hoc programs, use a seven days response window, as these programs typically require faster action. 
 
5. The **Team Conversations Window** should remain open for a manager and their team to finish their conversation after the survey closes. Once set, the program indicates the conversation start and end date scheduled, and how many days remain. Visit Team Conversations for a deeper dive.

   **Best Practice**: Use our 28 days default window (about four weeks), although the window can be set for up to 180 days (about six months). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Response window refers to the number of days the survey is open to responders and is not related to Team Conversations.
 
6. Select the right-facing arrow symbol to **Save & Continue**.
