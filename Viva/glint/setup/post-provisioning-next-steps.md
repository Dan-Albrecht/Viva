# Set up your Viva Glint instance

Welcome to Microsoft Viva Glint! If you have landed on this page, you should already have your tenant provisioned.

- If you haven't already completed tenant provisioning, [set up a Microsoft Viva tenant](viva-glint-tenant-provision.md).
- If you have completed tenant provisioning, follow these next steps to continue Viva Glint deployment.

## Add administrators to your Viva Glint instance

As the tenant Global Admin, you're the default Microsoft Viva Glint Service Admin. This means you have ultimate control over the subscriptions in your Viva Glint product and you can access all data. Additionally - and importantly - you can assign Viva Glint Service admin roles to other users.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators for Viva Glint are assigned within the Viva Glint product only, not through the Microsoft Administrator Center (MAC).

> [!TIP]
> Viva Glint recommends no more than five (5) administrators for your Viva Glint instance.

### Collect administrator information

Compile a file of administrators to upload to Viva Glint with the following columns and user information. Save as **.csv with UTF-8 encoding and a comma separator**.

- **Email:** Work email address
- **Employee ID:** ID value exactly as it appears in your HRIS
- **First Name:** User first name
- **Last Name:** User last name
- **Status:** ACTIVE, in all caps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent duplication errors with future file uploads, ensure that the Employee ID values for these users match the Employee ID from the HR Information System (HRIS) that will be used to transfer data to Viva Glint. 

### Upload administrators to Viva Glint

Upload your administrators to Viva Glint Advanced Configuration:

1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configure** symbol, then in **Service Configuration**, choose **Advanced Configuration**.
1. In the **Advanced Configuration** menu, select **Uploads**.

1. In the **Upload Job Details** page that appears, confirm that **Upload Lines Summary** shows the correct number of users to ADD in the **Lines** column.
1. Select **Apply Upload to Database** to upload new users and select **Yes**.
1. Go to the **Uploads** menu and confirm that the file **State** is SUCCESS and that the **Total Lines** and **Processed Lines** match the number of users in the uploaded file.

### Add administrators to the Company Admin User Role

When users are successfully uploaded, add them to the Company Admin User Role and grant Advanced Configuration access:

1. Select the **Configure** symbol, then in the **Employees** section, choose **People**.
1. Select each user, and on their profile under **User Roles**, select the pencil symbol to edit.
1. In the **Customize User Role** dialog, select the checkbox for **Company Admin** and then choose **Save**.
1. In the **Confirm Role** dialog, select **Grant All Access**.
1. On the user profile, in the **Company Admin: Advanced Configuration Access** section, select the pencil symbol to edit.
