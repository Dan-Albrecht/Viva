# Export a Viva Glint Distribution List

Admins can export Distribution Lists to quickly see the list of employees receiving a survey or the members of a group with specific permissions. This is especially useful for large teams. 

> [!NOTE]
> The option to export distribtuion lists is not available for Employee Lifecycle surveys.

## Manage exports in two ways 

All exports generate a CSV download. Downloads may take a few minutes dependent upon list size.

1. Select  **Export**. 

### Export Distribution Lists from the admin dashboard 

Distribution Lists are dynamic; the targeted population may change until the survey is sent.  Any list exported after the survey is sent an actual recipient list.  

Distribution List files include first and last name, email address, and employment status. 

1. From your Glint admin dashboard, select the  **Configuration**  symbol and then  **Distribution Lists**.
