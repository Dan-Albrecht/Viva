# Set up a successful program with your Works Council

Works Councils or Unions are an essential partner when implementing an employee survey program. In some countries, gaining Works Council agreement before deploying new technology is a legal requirement, so plan ahead. While every organization has a unique proposition that they’ll have to present to their Works Council, there are some themes that you can start focusing on now.

## Five tips to get started

When it comes to partnering with your Works Council, advanced preparation is key. 

Tip #1: **Start the dialogue early.** Works Council meetings can often be planned months in advance, and approval can take a long time. Get it on the agenda as soon as is practical.  

Tip #2: **Find out what’s on the minds of your Works Council members.** Get an idea of what questions to expect and what issues worry them and learn what things they are already comfortable with. 

Tip #3: **Offer to join your Works Council’s meetings to provide support.** Written materials are often sufficient, but sometimes the personal touch can signal that there is nothing to hide and sets a good atmosphere of support.  

Tip #4: **Treat your Works Council as another stakeholder in the process.** Works Council is interested in employees’ opinions and should be receptive to the concept of an employee engagement survey and ensure that it’s implemented well. 

Tip #5: **Find out what approvals are needed, by when, and by whom.**  Sometimes there are limited windows to get approval from your Works Council. Know how to navigate the necessary approval. 

## Five questions you might hear

These are commonly asked questions from Works Councils. 

Question #1: **Do you and your third-party providers demonstrate compliance with GDPR and local implementing law?** Explain the overarching [data security and privacy strategy](add-privacy-policy.md).

Question #2: **How do you and your third-party providers protect your data?** Ensure the confidentiality, availability and security of your data. 

Question #3: **How do you and your third-party providers store your data?** Provide information on what is stored, where, and for how long.  

Question #4: **How do you control access to your data?** Explain access rights and access controls (manager/employee access, passwords, SSO, etc.). 

Question #5: **What system audits and certifications do you and your third-party providers have?** Show evidence of an industry-standard audit (likely an annual SOC 2 Type II) and various Privacy-Shield certifications.
