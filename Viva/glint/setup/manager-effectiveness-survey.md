# Set up a Viva Glint Manager Effectiveness survey

Microsoft Viva Glint’s Manager Effectiveness program helps develop stronger managers through frequent team feedback and data-driven insights specific to each manager. Viva Glint uses this data to provide managers with action plans to improve their effectiveness. These plans include learning resources and tracking tools.

As a part of Viva Glint’s integrated employee engagement platform, Manager Effectiveness lays the foundation for seamless assessment, analytics, and action planning across the complete manager experience.

Viva Glint provides customizable survey content that covers key areas of manager performance. These areas represent industry best practices including priority setting, decision making, collaboration and communication, as well as how well managers provide motivation, recognition, career development, and feedback to their teams. Each area includes best practice content and suggested actions to help managers improve.
