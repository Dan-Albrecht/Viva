# Use the Viva Glint Question Library

From the admin dashboard, in the **Survey** section, you'll find the **Question Library**. Microsoft Viva Glint’s Question Library contains hundreds of questions and statements that can be included in your surveys. If you choose a template for a specific survey type, the questions and statements that best support the survey goal are prepopulated into the template. You can create and edit items from the Question Library, but Viva Glint suggests that you use our standard questions as most are mapped to benchmarks.
 
From the Question Library you can: 

- Search items by type of question, key driver, benchmark, and whether translations are available 
- Import and export questions – used for language translations 
- Edit or create questions 
- Sort by Viva Glint standard question or a custom question you have created or edited 
- View the number of programs in which you have used this question or statement 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Changes made to the Question Library: 
   >  - When a reporting label is changed, it will instantly propagate to all programs, past and present.
   > - When question text is changed, it propagates to future programs only.

## The implication of customizing Question Library items 

Viva Glint has done extensive research to identify the most reliable and valid items linked to survey goals, and our benchmarks are created using the exact text from these items. Even a slight change to a question or statement can alter the meaning enough to invalidate a comparison to the benchmark.  

   > [!TIP]
   > In cases where text is altered to sufficiently alter the item's meaning, we do not keep the benchmark and this item is considered customized. While losing a benchmark might seem like a disadvantage, using items that are most relevant to your organizational needs and measuring progress over time are more impactful.

   
We recommend that you do not customize standard survey items as customized items should not map to external benchmarks. If making a change to our standard survey items, we recommend duplicating the question and creating a customized version. 

### Custom questions interfere with question mapping 

Once you have selected your questions that align to your organizational strategies, you may decide to compare trending data from previous surveys to your current survey. If you do decide to compare historical data to new items moving forward, it's vital that the previous and new questions are truly comparable. If historical data isn't aligned to new insights, a client risks misinterpreting the results, not having clear connections from historical to new insights or proceeding with misguided action steps. To ensure true comparisons between previous and new results, it's essential to match items accurately.​ 

#### Mapping guidelines 

To map, you must consider the wording, item intention and referents.

#### Item intention 

If items have different wording, they can still be mapped, provided the intention of the historical item aligns with the intention of the item it’s being mapped to – they must have the same aimed purpose and outcome:

#### Item referent 

To gain specific insights, an item will always have a referent (for example, Company, senior leadership, direct manager, team, coworkers or even the employee themselves). If two items have similar intentions but are aimed at different referents, they can't be mapped.

## Edit items from the Question Library 

There may be cases where slight edits to wording can be accommodated without altering the meaning; in these cases, Viva Glint will be able to apply the item to benchmark data.  

Any item can be edited by hovering over and selecting the row that the item appears on in the Question Library. An Edit Question panel displays. From this panel you can: 

1. Edit the question, and  
1. View associated programs 

### Procedure to edit a question: 

1. Choose the language. Languages for which this item has been translated will be visible in the dropdown menu. 
1. Change the item type, if applicable. 
1. Edit the reporting label, if desired. 
1. Edit the item text, if desired. 
1. Add instruction text that helps the user understand the meaning of the item. 
1. Add comment placeholder text, if desired. 
1. Change the rating scale, if applicable. 
1. Indicate whether the label explanation for ratings should be shown. 
1. Enable or disable commenting. 
1. Choose whether the item is optional or mandatory.
1. Map the item to a Suggested Action Template, if desired. 
1. Select **Save Changes**. 

#### Examples of edits that won't inactivate a benchmark 

1. Example 1: Matching the language of the business 
   - Standard: I would recommend my *manager* to others.  
   - Modified: I would recommend my *supervisor* to others.  
   - Recommendation: Modifying a term in the item to make it more specific to your organizational language is acceptable and doesn't affect the benchmark.  
 
1. Example 2: Using synonyms  
   - Standard: The recruitment process was *excellent*.  
   - Modified: The recruitment process was *great*.  
   - Recommendation: If the replacement word is likely to be interpreted similarly, the item change is acceptable.  

#### Examples of edits that inactivate a benchmark 

1. Example 1: Altering the subject
   - Standard: *I feel empowered* to make decisions regarding my work.
   - Modified: *My manager empowers me* to make decisions regarding my work.  
   - Recommendation: Altering the subject in an item changes the way people respond, and the benchmark will no longer be available. 
  
1. Example 1: Altering the subject 
   - Standard: My manager *provides me with feedback that helps me improve my performance*.  
   - Modified: My manager and *I have regular conversations*.  
   - Recommendation: When the meaning of an item has been fundamentally altered, the change isn't recommended, and the benchmark is no longer available.    

### View associated programs 

Use this tab to see if this item is associated with any existing program. To add it to a program, use the [Questions page in Program Summary](https://www.microsoft.com). 

## Add new items to the Question Library 

Select the **+ Create Question** button on **the Question Library** page. In the Create Question slider panel that opens, set up the same items that appear above in Procedure to edit a question. Follow that procedure to create a new item to add to your organization’s Question Library. You'll now be able to see it in the Name column, sorted alphabetically by key driver. 

## Export, translate, and import items 

English is the default language for all Viva Glint programs. You may choose to survey and send email communications to your employees in their preferred language rather than the default language. Glint provides its customers with more than 70 language translation offers for standard content. Language translations can be set during the initial survey configuration or added later as needed. 

To support this, Viva Glint allows admins to export all program content - including questions and items from the Question Library - into .csv and .xlsx format. Exporting a file that includes English and all relevant translations allows users to review, add or edit translations in one place versus copying and pasting one language at a time into the platform. 

There are four steps you use for translating Question Library items: 

1. Export the items. 
1. Employ a translator to make translations. 
1. Use a translation reviewer to verify translations. 
1. Import the items back into the platform. 

### Export your items for language translation 

The first step for translating language translations is to export the list of items.  

1. Select **Export Questions** from the **Actions** dropdown menu. 

1. Choose the language(s) to include from the search box in the Choose Which Language to Export dialog box, which opens. 

1. Select your export format from *.csv* or *.xlsx*. 

1. Select **Export**. A dialog box lets you know that your file is being downloaded. 

1. After the report is downloaded, select **Close Window**. 

### Translate the exported items 

From this file that has been generated: 

1. Use a translator to make exact changes to the items in column C for the approved English text in column B. 
1. Further to the right, consider other items that might require translation: reporting labels, Multiple Choice questions, and ratings labels.  
1. Use your translation reviewer to ensure that the translated items match exactly to the approved item from the Question Library. 

### For translators:

**Do’s**: 
- Keep the translated content in the same cell and columns. 
- Ensure that there are no spaces added before/after the updated content. Ensure there is also consistent punctuation at the end of sentences (that is, all using a period or none using a period). 
- Check for grammatical errors.

**Don’ts**:  
- Do not edit, translate, or delete any bracketed text such as {user first name}, `<COMPANY_NAME>` or {{company name}}. It must stay the same for personalization coding. There is no need to translate anything in brackets. If questions containing brackets are changed, ensure brackets around the text are balanced (that is, one bracket at the start and one at the end, or two at the start and end). 
- Do not make visual, formatting, or other stylistic changes unless it improves clarity. Changes should never alter the meaning conveyed in the original English text. 
- Do not add personal comments. `
- Do not add new or additional columns or remove columns. 

### For translation reviewers

**Do’s**: 
- Focus on copy-editing by fixing any typos or grammatical errors. 
- Confirm that the original meaning of the question remains intact. 
- Keep translated content in the same cell and columns. 

**Don’ts**:  
- Do not rewrite entire sentences.  
- Do not move translated content to different cells or columns.  
- Do not add personal comments. 
   
### Import your translated items 

Back on the **Question Library** page, select **Import Questions** from the dropdown **Actions** menu. 

1. Drag and drop or browse to find the translated file and place it in the box. 

1. Select **Next**. 

1. If everything looks as expected, select **Make Changes**.
