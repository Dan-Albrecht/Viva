# Use the Glint Microsoft Teams Application 

>[!NOTE]
> This guidance is for customers who are already using the Glint Microsoft Teams application. It is currently unavailable for new users. Viva Glint will announce a new and streamlined Microsoft Viva Glint Teams application in 2023 and customers can add it to their package then.

Glint built a Microsoft Teams integration system, which enables your people to receive and reply to survey notifications directly from Teams. Microsoft Teams notifications are easier to receive and reply to than regular email communications as they're a part of the regular workday.  

## Map the application to employee email IDs 

The Glint Microsoft Teams App relies on an employee’s Microsoft Team’s email ID matching the employee’s Glint email ID. Likely, they're the same, but it's important to be certain ahead of time. When the app is installed for an employee, Glint will receive the employee’s Teams email ID and if this email ID exists in your employee data file, we'll link the two accounts. If the two email IDs are different, the integration can't work for that employee.  

## Admins can turn off Glint Microsoft Teams for selected programs 

The default setting for the application is ON, but the company admin can disable it: 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** (cogwheel icon) and then Survey Programs. 
2. Select the survey and then **Communications** in Program Summary.  
3. In the Channels box, switch Microsoft Teams to **OFF**.  

## Turning off Glint Microsoft Teams for selected Nudge groups 

The default setting for the application to send Nudge notifications is ON for all recipient groups. To disable for specific groups:   

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Nudges**. 
2. In the Configuration section, choose **View Details** for the recipient group to be disabled.  
3. In the Channels box, switch Microsoft Teams to **OFF**.   

## View who is enabled for the Glint Microsoft Teams Application 

From the admin dashboard:  

1. Select **Configure** and then **People** in the Employee section.  
2. Choose an employee group and then a specific employee name.  
3. On the User Details page, you can see whether Glint Teams integration is enabled. 

## Preview what survey notifications look like in Teams 

Without having to apply an active survey - which might affect response rates - admins can send themselves a Teams preview to see what their manager receives. From the admin dashboard:  

1. Select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**. 
2. Select a program.  
3. In the *Upcoming* and *Live*, select the vertical ellipses.  
4. Select **Preview Survey** from the dropdown menu. From Preview As, select the individual you will preview the survey as. Then select:
   - Email me the survey sample 
   - Send me the survey sample via Teams 
   - Both 
5. Select **Preview Survey**.   

>[!NOTE]
> You will not receive the Teams preview unless you are certain that you have enabled Microsoft Teams in the Communications section of General Settings. 

## Export a list of Glint enabled users for Microsoft Teams 

From the admin dashboard:  

1. Select **Configure** and then **General Settings** in the Client Settings section.  
2. In the Communications section, if Microsoft Teams is enabled (YES), you have the option to **Export number enabled Glint user**.  
3. Follow on-screen guidance to receive a *.CSV* file of the enabled users.
