# Import and export Viva Glint User Roles

Admins can import and export lists of members associated with specific roles and attributes. This functionality is especially useful for large teams.

## Import User Roles in bulk

When you need to assign many individuals to a specific User Role, you can mass assign them by using the bulk import feature.

### Procedure to import User Roles in bulk

1. Select the **Configure** symbol.
2. In the **Employees** section, select **User Roles**. Select the User Role you need to update.
3. On the **Role Settings** page, select **Export.** Within the box that displays, make your selections and then again, select **Export**.
4. Open the downloaded .csv file and delete all columns except the column with email addresses.
5. Add or delete email addresses.
     >[!NOTE]
     >This can be a full replacement for the existing file, so you will not need to have an Add or Remove column.
6. Save your file.
7. Return to the **Role Settings** page and select **Import**.
8. Select the checkbox to indicate if you only added users.
9. Drag and drop your file, or browse to select your file, into the area indicated.
10. Select **Import File**.
11. Confirm your import and then select **Confirm Import**.

## Manage exports

All exports generate a .csv download. Downloads may take a few minutes dependent upon list size.

### Export roles

This export includes first and last names, email address, and employment status.

1. From your admin dashboard, select the **Configuration**  symbol and then **User Roles.**
2. Select the role list you would like to export.
3. Select  **Export** on the **Role Settings** page.
4. Choose whether to include all user attributes and User Roles.
5. Select  **Export**.
