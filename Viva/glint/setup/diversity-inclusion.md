# Diversity and Inclusion survey program in Viva Glint

Fostering a strong sense of belonging in your organization is essential. Customer data shows that employees who feel a strong sense of belonging are over six times as likely to be engaged as those employees who don’t. 

Belonging is strong when:
- work environments are inclusive of differences.
- everyone feels accepted.
- everyone can bring their best selves to work.

The Microsoft Viva Glint Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) approach helps organizations measure perspectives that matter and empower managers to build inclusive practices. The D&I approach fosters an understanding of how to create an environment where all people feel they belong.

> [!NOTE]
> The Glint survey strategy can incorporate domains of diversity, belonging and inclusion into any survey, voiding the need for a standalone Diversity and Inclusion measurement. For this reason, consider adding items from Glint's D&I survey template to an engagement or a culture survey.
