# Set up a Viva Glint Team Effectiveness survey

The bulk of modern work is team-based and while organizations rely heavily on teams to get work done, few have specific measurements to evaluate the components of what makes an effective team. Most organizations focus solely on individual performance, instead of seeking to understand what contributes to high team performance. For organizations to realize their full potential, a greater focus is needed on measuring and facilitating team effectiveness. In other words, shift the focus from who is on the team, to how they work together.

Microsoft Viva Glintâ€™s Team Effectiveness survey is a diagnostic assessment that shows how teams are working and communicating. Survey results provide prescriptive guidance to enhance collaboration and productivity.

## What is the best cadence to use for a Team Effectiveness survey?

Setting up a Team Effectiveness survey as a recurring, stand-alone program or as an Always-On survey allows your leaders to use the program whenever it's needed.

> [!TIP]
> Repeat the survey in one-two months to check on progress made and adjust actions as needed.
