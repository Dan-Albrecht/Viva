# Integrate Viva Glint into Viva Insights (preview)

HR analysts and other leaders in your organization can bring Microsoft Viva Glint survey scores into Microsoft Viva Insights to learn how people feel – Glint- along with how people work - Insights.  This integration gives your organization a complete picture of the employee's experience.

## Workflow overview

## What data can be sent to Viva Insights?
Data that can be sent:
- Data from recurring or ad-hoc surveys with confidentiality thresholds equal to or above the Viva Glint default of five respondents.
- Rating item scores, but no comments.
- All Viva Glint languages supported for question labels (names) and question text are sent to Viva Insights Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Global admins cannot include Works Council employee data in the Viva Insights integration.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By sending data to Viva Insights, you agree to have Microsoft Viva Glint data sent and stored within Microsoft Viva Insights.

## Set up the Viva Insights integration from your admin dashboard

After the Viva Insights admin sets up the import and contacts you that the process is ready for you to share Viva Glint survey data, follow these steps:

1. From your Glint admin dashboard, select the **Configure symbol** and then **Viva Insights** from the *Microsoft Viva Integrations* section.

## Sending and managing data

This guidance is for the initial sending of data to Insights.

1. On the *Send Data to Viva Insights* page, **Select Programs** by enabling the checkbox next to the recurring or ad hoc program listed. You can choose more than one program.

4. Select **Close.**

4. A message confirms that your program or programs have been added. 

5. Be sure that the name of the program you added now appears under Programs on the Send data to Viva Insights page.
   
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Selecting a program sends data for every closed program cycle and automatically sends data for future cycles. In Viva Insights, you’ll be able to map which program data to display on the Viva Insights dashboard.

### Data validation and processing

After sending data from Viva Glint, the Insights app validates it and provides status messages about the import. 
If processing fails, try running the import again, and resending your survey data. If you’re still getting a failed status, [file a support ticket](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support).

## Glint data deletions result in Insights data deletion

As your company’s data controller, Microsoft Viva Glint admins can submit a user data deletion request to comply with a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject request. 

User data is deleted from the *People* section on the Viva Glint admin dashboard. Any data deleted from Glint is deleted from Insights, as well. [Data deletion instructions here.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236554).

## Remove a program after initial setup

After sending data to Viva Insights, you can continue to manage your integration. You can stop sharing future data with Viva Insights by removing the program. Return to your Viva Glint admin dashboard and follow the same instructions as you did in the initial setup. The Setup integration button now reads Manage integration.

1. Select **Manage Integration**.

2. Hover over the ellipses next to the program to reveal the actions available. Select Remove program.
