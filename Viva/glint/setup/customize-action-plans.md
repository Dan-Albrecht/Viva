# Customize Action Plans in Viva Glint    

Suggested Action templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint includes as suggested resources to help managers achieve team-approved Focus Areas. Resources used in Action Plan templates must first exist in Content Resources.

## Viva People Science explains Focus Areas and Action Plans

Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience. It's designed to increase work engagement on your team and within your company.
