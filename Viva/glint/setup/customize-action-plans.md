# Customize Action Plans in Viva Glint    

Suggested Action templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint includes as suggested resources to help managers achieve team-approved Focus Areas. 

Access **Suggested Action templates** from the *Action Taking* section on your admin dashboard.

## Viva People Science explains Focus Areas and action planning

Initiating and managing action after a survey can be an unclear process. Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. **An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience. It is designed to increase work engagement on your team and within the company.***

## Understand terminology associated with action plans 

This terminology assists with understanding how Viva Glint sets up Action Plan templates: 

|Term|Definition|
|---------|---------|
|**Driver**|A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface key (or core) drivers|
|**Suggested Action Templates**|The overall template associated with a survey item. Choosing a **Focus Area** via the **Take Action** command within survey results directs managers to the Suggested Action Template associated with that chosen key driver|
|**Suggested Action Items**|The components of a Suggested Action Template| 
|**Content Resources**|Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that make up Suggested Action Items|

## Specifications for adding Content Resources 

Access **Content Resources** from the *Action Taking* section on your admin dashboard. 

All content that exists in *Content Resources* is considered **Viva Glint standard content**. Content may exist as articles, images, PDF files, or videos. Content must first exist or be added in *Content Resources* before it is attached to a Suggested Action template.

### Character limits for Content Resources**: 

| **Field** | **Character limit** |
