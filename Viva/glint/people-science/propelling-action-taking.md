# Propel Action-taking through conversations - Viva People Science

The likelihood of employee feedback fueling organizational success hinges on the actions taken based on that feedback. Many companies build excitement and energy around taking the survey: "We want to hear from you!" and "Thank you for the feedback!". However, the momentum often slows somewhere between "Here’s what we’re going to do about your feedback!" and what actually gets done to address issues and make positive incremental changes.

## Compelling data points reveal why action taking is critical 

Compelling data points show action taking is critical:

- People who don't believe action is taken are 7x more likely to
be disengaged than people who don't believe action is taken.

- Teams where the manager uses action planning in the Glint
platform show a 7% increase in scores on average.

- Teams that score high on action planning are more likely to say that they have confidence in the leadership team. They are more likely to be  excited about the future prospects of the company.

- A single quarter is enough time to see increases in scores across varying teams when action is taken.

- Regardless of the area on which action is taken, there is a high likelihood that confidence in leadership increases, and this sentiment has an indirect effect on engagement & performance.

## Why isn't action-taking working today?

### Ownership of action is unclear

Everyone agrees that acting on feedback is important. However, often it’s unclear who is responsible for action taking or the
necessary actions are unequally distributed. 

In some organizations, taking action on engagement results is seen as HR’s responsibility. Glint data shows that employees typically expect
HR and leadership to own the actions that result from survey results. That result isn't unexpected as in many organizations, front-line managers don’t
receive results for their teams. If they do receive results, they receive them weeks or months later. This is often viewed as a good practice because it gives each level of
leadership time to synthesize results and prepare responses. Inadvertently, it signals
to managers that engagement data is not theirs to own and improve.
As a result, managers often shift the responsibility of acting and
communicating actions to leadership and HR. For this reason, HR teams feel responsible for addressing all the feedback during an engagement survey and that feeling is overwhelming for already stretched teams. Finally,
limited interaction between senior leadership and employees means that employees have less visibility into the actions being taken.

Even in organizations where ownership is shifted to
front-line managers, challenges still exist. Managers often believe that
they bear the entire responsibility of action-taking and that they must
respond to every opportunity surfaced in the results. This result is more obvious
when surveys are long, giving managers hours of work to comb through results and countless problems to fix. Instead of
feeling empowered, they feel deflated.

### Support and enablement is limited

Managers play a critical role in fostering engagement and learning
within an organization, but many lack the tools and support they need to
contribute effectively to team performance and development. First-time
managers on the front-line manage nearly as much as two-thirds of the
workforce, and over half of these managers don’t get adequate training
to prepare them for these roles.

### Complex action plans are unsustainable

Many action-taking processes overthink on the planning instead of the actual execution.
Creators of the Agile Manifesto know that it’s more important to respond to change than follow a plan.
When 80% of action-taking effort is focused on developing long, detailed
action plans, the process feels cumbersome. Cumbersome processes are easy to de-
prioritize them when other business needs arise. This sentiment is especially true when
surveys only occur once per year or every other year. When managers
feel they have 12 or more months to make improvements, they’re more
likely to overplan and overcommit. And it’s likely they lose
momentum before they cactually start to take sustainable action!
Bottom line, lengthy action plans, built into
a silo can take months to act upon. Unless people are enabled to
build good and simple habits around sustainable action taking, it’s likely
to run out of steam.

### Feedback can feel hard to act on

Whether giving or receiving feedback, people shy away from being
direct because it feels uncomfortable, especially on teams that might
lack psychological safety. Feedback, which is
perceived as negative doesn’t always result in improvement because
most people want to avoid it. Feedback may feel like a personal attack
when managers see it as a reflection of their abilities. Some assume it’s their responsibility to fix all the issues while
others may feel like the issues are not under their control and defer the
responsibility. Rather than feeling empowered to make change happen
with their teams, they end up feeling deflated or helpless.

## Use an agile approach to taking action

In order for actions on feedback to be effective, they must become
part of the flow of how we work. This action is called “an agile approach”
to engagement. There are three key components to making engagement (or
any HR program) evolve to meet the changing needs of today’s world:

- **People** who have the right mindset, skills, and behaviors to support the
shift.
- **Technology** that puts the right information at people’s fingertips
with in a simple and delightful way.
- **Strategy** that aligns with the priorities and flow of work in a business.

Let’s unpack each of these components.

### People

It starts with awareness and education about the role everyone plays in
making your organization a great place to work. Show that everyone can
participate in productive conversations about survey results and feel
ownership over action. Start by releasing results to
all managers as quickly as possible. It’s critical that all managers are part
of this process so it feels transparent and inclusive. Outline clear
expectations for everyone, define straightforward steps, and equip your HR teams to coach managers and leaders to model the
right behaviors. No one person should be responsible for creating an engaged and high-performing workplace.

### Technology

The Glint platform was designed to put meaningful insights into the
hands of managers so teams can move to action. This process starts with an
intuitive interface that surfaces key insights based on modern OD
science. Viva Glint makes it easy to identify focus areas and provide guidance on what to do about it through:

- Strengths & Opportunities: A simple and highly actionable summary of what a manager does well and their growth opportunities.

- Narrative Intelligence: An award-winning natural language processing (NLP) engine that surfaces key themes and associated
sentiment from comment data so you can better understand employee feedback.

- Action items: Curated recommendations for actions that can be taken as well as an extensive resource library for how to improve in
any specific focus area.

- Manager Concierge: An in-platform coach that provides step-by-step guidance. The guidance should take into account the actions a manager has
taken and make intelligent recommendations for actions to take next to help their teams be more successful.

### Strategy

You need a sustainable and simple strategy to move from one-way
listening to effective action in an organization centered around the
right habits. Rethink how you invest your time. Instead
of improving your listening strategy, shift your focus and develop a
conversation strategy. Help your organization make quality feedback
conversations a habit. Quality conversations help managers and teams use data
to fuel action and change behaviors. Here are some key elements of a simple, agile strategy for taking action:

- **Share feedback more frequently.** Timely, relevant data informs
important business decisions and priorities and allows managers to
build habits through repetition. If people only get feedback once per
year, they have to learn interpretation and conversation skills all over
again every 12+ months.

- **Reduce the time between feedback and action.** Get out the data 
as soon as possible in the hands of teams so they can get started
working on it.

- **Have a laser focus on one impactful shift at a time.** Don’t focus your
team’s energy on creating long action plans.

- **Make adjustments and learn together.** Evaluate what’s working and
what’s not. Course correct along the way.

- **Create a simple check-in process.** Help teams collaborate and
hold each other accountable. This process can be a 30-minute check-in
from initial results and then 10 minutes on your monthly
weekly team meeting agenda to keep it alive. The key is not only to
discuss action when the survey results comes out.

## Understand that conversations matter

Even the best-laid action taking efforts often lose momentum a few
weeks after survey results are released. After the initial fervor that comes
with new information, other priorities take over. It’s not
uncommon for robust action plans to see little progress because there
is no simple mechanism to hold teams accountable for progress. The
missing ingredient to creating sustainable focus on taking action on
feedback is obvious and often overlooked: **Conversations.**

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/conversations-matter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the five reasons that conversations matter.":::

### Why do conversations matter?

Research shows that checking in and having conversations in
the workplace are critical to productivity and well-being. Unfortunately few
organizations fully grasp the art of having conversations that are
meaningful and propel progress.

### So what is the problem with conversations?

People give lots of excuses for avoiding important conversations. But at
the heart of it, it’s because:

- It’s not always clear how to facilitate a good conversation and
therefore the value is unclear.

- Conversations about feedback can feel awkward and/or intimidating.

**This is the reason Viva People Science developed the ACT Conversation Guide**. The ACT Conversation Guide serves as
a simple framework for having productive conversations that foster
meaningful connection and continuous improvement. The conversation
framework allows managers and teams to practice the critical steps of a
quality feedback conversation and make it a habit.

## Why ACT works

The ACT conversation guide is built on a combination of behavioral science
and practical expertise on what fuels change within organizations. 

**Acknowledge**
**Collaborate**
**Take one step forward**

### ACT conversations create trust on teams

By openly sharing and discussing feedback, trust improves on teams, a crucial building block for creating high
performing teams. ACT inherently requires managers bring their survey
data to the team meeting for open discussion, rather than deciding what
the problem and solution are on their own. The conversations prompts
within **Acknowledge** encourage the manager to bring their hypotheses instead from reviewing the data to the team and work together to identify the
most impactful focus area. Additionally, most of the **Collaborate** prompts
are written with the intention of maximizing psychological safety on
teams. People avoid having difficult
conversations, choosing instead to indulge in counterproductive
behaviors like complaining to others, doing unnecessary work, or getting
angry. Facing challenges head on can be tough but can create a feeling of
safety to have conversations that matter.

### ACT conversations help employees appreciate each other and reinforce the positive

Feedback is a gift and we need to encourage it. **Acknowledge,**tips
encourage sharing stories of positive progress in the last few months. This method ensures you focus on the
positive in addition to what needs to improve.

### ACT conversations drive focus

We know focus is critical to effectiveness. Unfortunately, we often forget to aggressively prioritize how to take action on feedback.
It’s not uncommon for organizations to become overwhelmed by the
number of issues that arise in their survey feedback and overcommit to
solving everything - all at once. The result is that organizational energy
and resources are often diluted and nothing fundamentally changes.

We commonly hear managers say “If we asked the question in a survey,
we have a responsibility to address it.” We don’t believe that to be true.
Employees understand that everyone is busy and that resources are limited. So as long as they play a part in prioritizing and they see
progress, they know their feedback is valued.
Additionally, most items in Glint surveys are statistically correlated, which
means that if you improve one item, you are likely to see other items
improve. With **Collaborate** prompts, teams can laser focus
on solving one thing. The use of one in **Take one step forward** is
intentional to keeping team commitments manageable and bite-sized.

### ACT conversations get to the root of the behaviors that help or hinder progress

It’s common for eager teams to tackle a problem by creating a new solution
to address it. With the right intentions, we add new things to do
without taking anything away. Often, change requires as much undoing
as doing. In the **Collaborate** phase, we ask teams to discuss
what behaviors we need to start, stop, continue. Talk openly about what we need to stop doing. This method is important for two
reasons: it creates focus and it makes it okay for team members to dissent
and be open and proactive about derailers.

### ACT conversations identify individual commitment

Social theory shows that when you
believe responsibility is diffused, you are less likely to make an effort
to solve it. If you believe improving team morale and engagement is
someone else’s problem, it’s unlikely you're part of making
things better. While managers have a clear role to play, each
member on the team can influence the outcome. In **Take one
step forward**, we encourage individual commitments for progress and a commitment on when to check-in next.

### ACT conversations foster an environment of ongoing learning

Focusing less on achieving a goal and more on ongoing learning creates a growth
mindset where we persist in the face of obstacles, embrace challenges
and seek inspiration from others. **Acknowledge** conversation
prompts nudge the team to share what’s working and what’s not
in ongoing check-in meetings. During the **Collaborate** phase, we
encourage deconstructing what we need to start, stop, and continue
doing to improve outcomes. By transparently surfacing lessons learned,
we can grow together rather than defaulting to fixed mindset triggers
that cause defensiveness. In the **Take one step forward** phase, teams commit
to when they check in again, signaling an initial chat is not the end of the
conversation.

### Create an agile, continuous improvement mindset

Do you believe engagement can be fixed with a silver bullet solution? Think again.
Research shows that organizations that have an agile approach
to people success are more likely to see business success. At the
heart of an agile approach is that we can’t always get it right the first
time. We must continuously learn from mistakes and iterate. Rather
than over-focus on developing a detailed plan, the ACT conversation
guide prompts teams to commit to one simple change over the course
of a few weeks, share lessons learned, and repeat the process. 

We love the concept of shifting. Shifting doesn’t require monumental change. It’s the alteration of a simple behavior or habit that
everyone can easily make. Here are examples of shifts that could come
out of an ACT Conversation:

- For a recognition focus: Start regular meetings with each team
member recognizing someone else on the team for their support.

- For an empowerment focus: The manager invites the team to come
up with the top three things they want to delegate and commit to at the next team meeting.

- For a risk-taking focus: At the end of each week, the manager sends
a note out asking team members to respond if they tried something
different this week and share how it went.

- For a downward communication focus: The manager sends team
three bullet points after each leadership meeting with key points for people to know.

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint platform has many more ideas of small shifts in the action resources associated with each driver.

## Are ACT conversations just one more thing we have to do?

No! We know leaders and managers — really all of us — are already too
busy. Creating what feels like more work is a recipe for
failure. If you want acting on survey feedback to be integrated into the
“way we do things around here," avoid these common pitfalls:

### Should action planning be a separate meeting?

Creating more meetings is not the answer. Make this topic part of your regular team meetings. Check-ins don’t have to be long. They can take up to 30 minutes of
your regular meeting when new survey results are out. From then on, a quick 10-15 minute check on progress to
is enough.

### Work on a problem that’s unrelated to key business activities or that you can’t easily influence

When taking action on feedback feels separate from your business priorities, it likely feels
burdensome. A manager should look at data with the lens of “What do we need to accomplish
as a team in the next 3-6 months? What do the survey results say about our ability to do that?" By putting feedback in the context of
strategic objectives, working on something new and working effectively becomes a priority.

## What is the manager's role?

**Driving engagement and performance is a team sport.** Leadership has a role to play in influencing many key drivers such as:
decision-making, collaboration, prospects, and purpose. When feedback results show up as system-wide focus areas, it’s becomes clear that senior leadership
needs to own some of the actions.

**Managers play an important role in taking action on feedback because they are close to the experience and
create accountability**. Given this unique
positioning, managers can craft solutions to enhance what matters most
to their people and use existing processes to drive progress.
Managers can then use survey feedback to build closer connections within
their teams and increase participation in making things better.
This process benefits the company - and its employees - and is more
meaningful than only a change in engagement score.

**The role of the manager in the feedback process is not to fix
engagement problems in their silo but to own the ongoing conversations
about taking action that fuel progress.**

More specifically, they need to play the role of:

 - **Coach:**-  Managers must show confidence in the team’s ability and
willingness to solve problems. They should provide direction to keep the
team on track and avoid going too broad or too deep. They should act
as a role model. If employees see managers displaying candor,
vulnerability, accountability, and focus, they are more likely to follow.
Managers send a signal about what’s important by what
behaviors they recognize and discuss publicly.

- **Facilitator:** - As a facilitator, managers help teams reach an outcome
that works for the group. Managers provide guidelines for
prioritization and decision making based on their knowledge of the
organization. As a facilitator, managers should seek out differing
opinions and ensure all voices are heard.

- **Roadblock Remover:** - Taking action can be tough due to
organizational constraints. Managers are the first-line of escalation to
help overcome roadblocks and often must navigate larger
organizational structures to help their teams drive change.

- **Connector:** - The most important role of the manager is to have
ongoing, meaningful conversations with their team that align with
priorities. Managers can check-in frequently through team meetings,
one-on-ones, etc. to ensure improvements are being made, then
course correct as needed. Managers can make connections to
other groups that may be working on similar challenges.

## Tips for making ACT work for your organization

- **The first step to building or changing a habit, is wanting to change
the habit!** At Glint we talk about feeling accountable versus holding
people accountable. When managers feel accountable for improving
engagement, they are much more likely to invest in building
good habits around action taking. Start with senior leaders role
modeling the right behaviors so managers are inspired to follow
their example.

- **Integrate ACt into ongoing processes such as performance
management conversations, stand-up meetings, business reviews,
staff meetings, etc.** Don’t add more meetings!

- **Tell stories.** Reliance on action plans and tracking often comes
from a desire to demonstrate progress to executives and other
stakeholders. Instead of focusing on activity, focus on impact. A
"check-the-box" mentality drives superficial change. Building
the right habits for effective conversations results in sustainable
improvements. Use stories to talk about how feedback and
conversations made a meaningful difference in the business. Did a
manager use the results to improve collaboration and deliver
a product on-time? Did an executive use employee
input as a compass to navigate major organizational change? These
stories show greater impact than sharing stats like “30% of managers
viewed results.”

- **Embed ACT principles - bite-sized feedback, dialogue and
collaboration between managers and teams, and quick, targeted
action - into other people practices, too.** ACT conversations are not just about survey
feedback. ACT conversations can build quality managers who can lead engaged teams.

## Summary

Having meaningful conversations that drive connection and focus is hard. ACT conversations 
require skill. By providing a simple framework focused on repeating the right habits, skills are learned. Once manager muscle
is built around feedback and connection, conversations become habits that
propel action and continuous improvement. And these habits won't be dependent on HR. When this culture embeds itself into an organization,
people feel heard and valued, and they can truly thrive.
