# How Viva People Science works with Viva Glint

The Microsoft Viva People Science team integrates traditional social sciences like behavioral and organizational psychology with advances in data science, product management, and design. Integrations allow us to reimagine how Viva apps can deliver exceptional and impactful experiences in the workplace.

Viva People Science brings unique points of view based on science-backed research, people-centric perspective, and a deep understanding of customer needs to help organizations craft meaningful employee experiences. Our knowledge and extensive experience creates a product that drives employee engagement and business results.

Glint work is focused on enabling people to bring their best selves to work, in order to do their best work. Years of People Science research tell us that there are **six core elements** that organizations should use to build effective cultures, people-centric leaders, and engaged employees. We refer to these six core elements as the [People Success Elements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-glint-blog/the-elements-of-people-success/ba-p/3791765). 

## Viva People Science - The People Success Elements

These People Success Elements are embedded throughout the Viva research and development process and within Viva Glint survey programs, guidance, resources, and training materials. They help drive engagement, productivity, and performance.
