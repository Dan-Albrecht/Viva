# How People Science works with Viva Glint

The Microsoft Viva People Science team integrates traditional social sciences like behavioral and organizational psychology with advances in data science, product management, and design to reimagine how Viva apps, such as Viva Glint, can deliver exceptional and impactful experiences in the workplace.

We bring unique points of view based on science-backed research, people-centric perspective, and deep understanding of customer needs to help organizations craft meaningful employee experiences. Our deep knowledge and extensive experience help us to create a product that will drive employee engagement and business results.

Our work is focused on enabling people to bring their best selves to work – in order to do their best work. Years of research tell us that there are six core elements that organizations can use to build effective cultures, people-centric leaders, and engaged employees. We refer to these six core elements as the [People Success Elements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-glint-blog/the-elements-of-people-success/ba-p/3791765). They include:

- **Wellbeing**: You feel physically and psychologically safe at work. You feel uniquely valued, and are treated with dignity, fairness, and equity.
- **Connection**: You feel a sense of belonging as a trusted, integral member of a diverse community of people you like and respect. You have high-quality relationships with your colleagues.
- **Clarity**: You know what success looks like and what to prioritize. You know when you are on track, and you get feedback that helps you change course as needed.
- **Empowerment**: You have access to the information, people, tools, and resources you need to work effectively. You're trusted with freedom and flexibility to own your work and make decisions about how to best direct your talent and effort.
- **Growth**: You're maximizing your strengths, learning new skills, diversifying your experience, and making progress.
- **Purpose**: You see how you're part of something bigger than yourself—how the work you do serves others and has a meaningful impact.

The six People Success Elements are embedded throughout the Viva research and development process and within Microsoft Viva's guidance, resources, and materials.
