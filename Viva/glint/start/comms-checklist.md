# Use the Viva Glint communications checklist

To create an effective way to inform your organization about surveys and feedback, use Viva Glint curated key questions and considerations. 

## Context

Ensure your rollout process and communications are in sync with the business. Be sure your program is perceived as an enabler to people and business success, rather than being seen as an HR event. Focus area improvements can be accelerated by using existing initiatives that address those areas.

- What upcoming company-wide and business unit initiatives, challenges, and events might occur during or after the survey period? Or for the remainder of the fiscal year?
- What people initiatives and investments are launching or are in development?

## Voice

- For your company-wide results communications, which senior leaders have the most impact in terms of building trust and accountability? 
- Should the same message go to all employees or should the message be customized for roles?

## Vehicle

- What channels are available for reaching different populations to ensure messaging is accessible, meaningful, and integrated into ongoing conversations? 
- What interactive channels are available where leaders can communicate in a personalized, authentic, and humble way?
- Can storytelling be included?
- Can you provide employees the opportunity for Questions & Answers? 

## Core Narrative

Consider your business and people context, company mission and values, and your business and people strategy.

- What is the core narrative for your post-survey messaging? 
- How do you want people to feel?
- What do you want people to understand and believe? 

## Enhanced Support

Consider credibility around the survey process. If your organization has seen a significant leadership change, a high volume of employee churn, past feedback resistance, or low morale - discuss:

- Are there teams that may need extra support for communications and building trust?
