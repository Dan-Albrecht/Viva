# Viva Glint’s Survey reports overview

Admins establish access to survey reports in the Reporting step of Program Summary for each specific User Role. Defining access status is available for recurring and ad-hoc survey programs.

## Report suggestions by role

Admins can assign specific reports for distinct roles.

| **Report name** | **Description** | **Intended for use by** |
|---|---|---|
| Alerts | Identifies statistically significant patterns, outliers, and deviations in your organization’s data, based on demographic attributes or combinations of attributes. Alerts surface business critical issues or strengths that may not have been initially identifiable. | Admins |
| Comments | Offers insights into employee verbatim comments, providing helpful context around survey scores. Highlights key topics, topic sentiment, topic connections, and prescriptive and representative comments. | Senior leaders, HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners), admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| Driver Impact | Allows managers to easily identify Strengths (areas the team should celebrate) and Opportunities (areas the team should work to improve engagement) based on key engagement driver scores. | All, but specifically managers |
| Executive Summary | Presents high-level data views for team presentations at all levels. This report resembles the overall dashboard view. | All |
| Goals Overview | Shows the status of completion of identified goals across teams. Provides critical insights briefly, with access to more details. | Admins and managers |
| Heat Map | Identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and corresponding drivers. Based on permissions, these can also be filtered by demographic attributes. | Senior leaders, HRBPs, admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| Overall Results | Mimics the Glint dashboard but allows data filtering and reviewing of more demographics. | All |
| Manager Report | Displays a *direct* or *role up hierarchy* view of all managers within a specific Manager/HRBP hierarchy. | Admins and managers |
| Response Rate Report | Provides a deep dive into survey response rates across hierarchies and key demographics. Displays trends and benchmark comparisons. | All |
| Team Summary | Captures employee feedback as an easy-to-use, insightful experience, designed to empower managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset, understand the unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement, and to encourage the next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on Focus Areas. | All |
|Multi-Attribute Export|Admins can deep dive into survey scores and view results of combinations for up to three attributes. The Multi-Attribute Export report is available for both engagement-type surveys and employee lifecycle surveys. | Admins|

## Choose reporting access level

There are two levels of reporting access you can choose for your leaders.

- **Live access**: Reporting access is readily available in real time as surveys are completed. Administrators will always have Live access and can't be included in Phased access rollout.
- **Phased access**: Recommended for managers and HRBPs (HR Business Partners) for action planning, tracking, and reviewing feedback results for *completed* surveys, excluding this role group from real-time, live survey results. Phased access is configured at the program level but occurs at the cycle level.

  >[!TIP]
  > Keep survey results classified while the survey is Live, among just a small group of leaders. Incomplete results may lead to unintended and inaccurate conclusions. *Feedback results aren't final until all results have been considered.*

## Change from Live access to Phased access

1. Switch to the **Completed** view and hover over the survey cycle.
2. Select the content in the **Reporting Access** column in that row.
3. The **Program Summary** page will display along with Reporting status.
4. Select **Grant Access**.
5. In **Grant Report Access**, check the box of the roles you wish to grant access to. Once access is granted, it can't be revoked.
6. Select **Provide Access**. The message *Visible to All Reporting Roles and Release Completed* confirms the change.

Once the next program cycle begins, and if the last cycle has Phased access, the access will default back to Live.
