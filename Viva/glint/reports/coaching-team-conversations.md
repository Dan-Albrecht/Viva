# Set up Viva Glint Team Conversations Presentation Kit for managers

The last survey setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. Managers who have Team Conversations enabled benefit from extra guidance made available within the setup of this page.

Program Summary setup occurs at the program level, not at the individual cycle level. The Coaching page appears differently for customers with Team Conversations enabled vs disabled.

- Coaching section: Setup required for all admins
- Team Conversations presentation guidance section: Visible with Team Conversations enabled only
- Team Conversation resource guidance: Visible with Team Conversations enabled only

**Customize Team Conversation Presentation Guidance to help your managers have successful conversations around survey results.**

- Team Conversations must be enabled. Do that in Program Setup
- If your program is already approved, toggle to **NO** so editing can occur. **Save changes**
- The presentation can't be set up after survey results have been released
- Managers will configure the *Pick a Focus Area* and *Choose Action Items* sections with their team. They are unable to make any other changes to the presentation

**The following information applies to each section:**

- The Section Name for each page is used for navigation and can be customized
- Customize content by selecting **Edit** to reveal the slider panel. You may use the default text content provided or customize
- **Preview** at any time
- **Save Changes** after editing each section
- Each translation added will auto-save after another language is selected

## Title

Add your spin to the first slide to welcome the team.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default

## Reflection Point

The presentation kit makes two Reflection Point pages available for managers. The first slide is for the team to consider *before* reviewing their results; the second slide is for *after* they have seen results. Both pages can be turned on or off.
