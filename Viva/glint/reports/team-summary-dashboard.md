# The Team Summary dashboard in Viva Glint

Team Summary is an enhanced survey results dashboard for managers that captures employee feedback in an easy-to-use and insightful way.

Team Summary is designed to:
 
- Empower managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset
- Understand the unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement 
- Encourage the next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on focus areas 

Team Summary is compatible with all recurring and ad hoc feedback surveys.

## Why use Team Summary? 

The likelihood of employee feedback fueling organizational success hinges on the actions managers take based on that feedback. While many companies build energy and excitement around taking the survey, momentum can slow after managers receive and view their results.

This can happen because:

- Data can feel overwhelming and difficult to make actionable. 
- Next steps aren't always clear. 
- Engagement feedback by a manager as a reflection of their performance. 

To overcome these challenges, Team Summary offers:
 
- **Clarification of insights**: data is presented in a simple, narrative format, so that managers at all levels can easily understand and interpret their teamâ€™s feedback. Personalized opportunity areas and tailored learning videos help managers focus directly on what is important to their team.
- **On-screen guidance**: provides reflection to reinforce interpretation of feedback with the intent in which it was given.
- **Guidance on next steps**: Viewing results is only the first step in improving engagement. Manager Concierge, an integral part of the Team Summary feature, guides managers through key next steps toward leading meaningful team conversations and setting Focus Areas to continue the ongoing process of improving engagement.
