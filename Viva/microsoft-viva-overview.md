#### Viva Engage
Brings people together across the organization to connect with leaders, coworkers, and communities. It can also help people crowdsource answers and ideas, share their work and experience, and find belonging at work. The Viva Engage app integrates these experiences into Microsoft Teams and introduces new features including storyline and stories. These new features will also appear in the Viva Engage web, desktop and mobile apps, so no matter where an employee visits, they’ll see the same content and feature set.

#### Viva Glint
Understand and improve employee engagement with this "voice of the employee" app. Organizations get immediate visibility into the employee experience with org-wide surveys and recommended actions to drive business outcomes. Questions and action plans are based on people science to guide employee listening and engagement programs that support the employee experience. Leaders and managers can view results to understand wins and opportunities, compare performance against benchmarks and receive personalized suggestions for learning courses, conversation starters, and other actions that support positive business outcomes.
