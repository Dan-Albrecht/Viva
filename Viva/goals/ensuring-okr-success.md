# Ensuring OKR program success at your company

You can ensure OKR program success at your company by following the recommended strategies in the [Viva Goals Adoption Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193441). At a high level, OKR success requires the following three components.

|Core component  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|OKR champions     |      OKR champions take initial ownership of OKR implementation internally and ensure its success on a continual and consistent basis. Typical OKR champions hold the roles of chief of staff, operations lead, and team manager, but anyone can be an OKR champion. Enterprise organizations typically need several OKR champions for a successful rollout.   |
|Leadership support     |    The most successful OKR programs have full support from the leadership team and strong executive sponsors. It's critical that senior leaders educate their respective organizations on the value of OKRs, explain why they're being implemented, reflect on their current culture, and identify key stakeholders.     |
|The right tools     |     OKRs are the best way to set goals, and Viva Goals is the best tool to manage your OKRs. Unlike spreadsheets or manual processes that become unwieldy, Viva Goals scales with your business and provides transparency across your organization.    |
