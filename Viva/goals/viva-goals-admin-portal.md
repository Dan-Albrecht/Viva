## Navigating the admin portal

The admin portal has three sections: General, Integrations, and Organizations.

### General

As a Viva Goals administrator, you can use this section to:

- [Choose who can create organizations](restrict-organization-creation-permissions.md).
- Configure settings relatred to the creation of OKRs and initiatives.
- Approve domains to be embedded in dashboards.
- Configure who can see Viva Goals Copilot.
- Configure whether OKRs are shared with Microsoft 365.
- Choose who can see Viva Goals in profile cards.
- Configure sharing permissions.

### Integrations

As a Viva Goals administrator, you can [choose which integrations](vg-integrations-administration-overview.md) are available for all Viva Goals organizations in the tenant.

### Organizations

As a Viva Goals administrator, you can use this section to:

- View the list of all organizations in the tenant. Select a record to view the organization information, such as the owner, admins, join access, number of teams, and members in the organization.

- Modify the org owner or org admin for any organization in the list. For example, to add or remove owners for an organization, select the organization's name within the list, then select the current organization owner in the resulting pane. After that, search for and select (or deselect) anyone you want to be (or not be) an owner for the org.

- Assign yourself as an owner or admin should there be a need to directly administrate the org. This gives you complete managerial control over an organization.
