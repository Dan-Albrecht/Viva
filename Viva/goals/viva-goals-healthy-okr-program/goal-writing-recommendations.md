# Goal writing recommendations

Looking to get started with a goal-setting program or take your goals from good to great? Here are some recommendations: 

1. **First, begin with the end in mind** 
   
    As a leader, if you're just getting started with setting goals or leading a rollout at your organization, one of the best ways to create lasting change is to first be clear about why goals are important for your team. 

    What is your motivation for setting and achieving goals (and why now)?  

    - To provide better visibility across your organization? 
    - To align remote workers around a common goal? 
    - To spearhead a new product launch? 
    - To provide focus to fend off a competitor? 
    
    Being clear on your "why" and communicating what success looks like to your organization will inspire and motivate employees as you incorporate goals into your rhythm of business.  
    
    As an employee, understand the benefits of goal setting for you: 

    - Priorities are more focused, so you have clarity about what you should be working on and why 
    - Visibility into top priorities for the entire organization, your own team, and cross-functional teams 
    - Ability to better prioritize work, so less time is wasted on nonbusiness critical initiatives 
    - Improved autonomy and ownership of your piece of business 
    - Greater alignment to every team member you work with 
    
1. **Just get started**
    
    Many organizations might be hesitant to elevate their goal planning process because they don’t want to make a mistake. But the bigger mistake is to keep waiting until everything is perfect, or worse, not get started at all.  

    Whether it’s starting at just the leadership level or letting your goal program take a grassroots approach and grow from the bottom up with a few ambitious teams, the important thing is to just get started. You’ll quickly learn what’s working, where you can make adjustments, and you might be surprised how quickly progress can be made when even just a few enthusiastic users or teams start seeing the benefits. 

1. **Keep things simple**

    A great piece of advice by Kevin Kelly is “If you can’t tell what you desperately need, it’s probably sleep.” In terms of goal setting, what we’ve seen across many companies is that if you're having difficulty setting or achieving goals, it’s probably because you have too many.  

    By their nature, inspiring leaders and great team members are ambitious and have no shortage of things they want to accomplish to move a business forward. But doing the opposite and narrowing down opportunities to just the absolute most important goals to focus on is more likely to lead to outsized returns.  

1. **Leverage the right tools**

    If you’ve got a single personal goal that you want to keep top of mind, a simple post-it note on your bathroom mirror might do the trick. But as you set business goals for your organization or team and align with your coworkers, it’s helpful to have two things … dedicated goal-setting software such as Microsoft Viva Goals, and a goal-setting framework such as Objectives and Key Results. 

    Once again, if you’re new to goal setting, the key is to keep things simple and just get started.
