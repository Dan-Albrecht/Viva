# Members page overview

Viva Goals allows organization owners/admins and team owners to view and manage members in their organization and/or teams. From these pages, you can view all the groups and individuals that have been added to an organization and/or team. You can also add or remove members (individuals and groups) and assign permissions from these pages. 

## Prerequisites and things to note 

[**Role and Permission**](roles-permissions-in-viva-goals.md): This page can be accessed by organization owners, organization admins, team owners, and team members.  

**Definitions:**

- **Organizations**: Typically, an organization in Viva Goals represents the company or business unit or a large department within the company.  

- **Teams**: A Team exists within an organization in Viva Goals. It's a group of users working towards a common set of team OKRs.

## Managing members for an Organization

You can view all members of an organization (individual members and groups) by navigating to Admin (in left nav bar) and selecting the Members tab. 

## How to view all members in Viva Goals organization: 

- The members’ page lists both individual members and groups in a single list. 

- If you want to view all the members of a group that has been added to the organization, hover on the group name on this page. This opens the group page that lists all the members of the group for Distribution groups and Microsoft 365 groups.  

- If you want to search for a specific member who has been added to the organization either individually or as part of a group, you can search for the member in the search bar at the top of the page. 

    - When you search for a user, for example, if you search for John, the search tool returns all results for John from Microsoft Entra ID (individuals and groups). This includes members and groups who are part of the organization and those who aren't.  

    - If you want to know if a user or group listed in the search result is part of the organization or not, select on the more options button (Three dots). The dropdown indicates whether the user or group is a member or a nonmember. 

        - If the user/group is already part of the organization, you'll be able to take more actions pertaining to the user/group.  

        - If the user/group isn't part of the organization, you'll be able to add the user/group to the organization, provided you have the permission to do so.  

## How to manage members/groups who are part of the organization:

### Deactivate a member from the organization:

- Search for the user from the search field in the members’ page 

- Select on the more options button next to the user in the search results. Select on deactivate. 

    - When a member is deactivated from Viva Goals, that member continues to be deactivated even if they are added to another group that is part of the organization. You'll have to manually reactivate this member to resume their access to the organization. 

    - To reactivate a user, you can search for the user, select on more options, and then select on reactivate. 

- Alternately, a member who was added to an organization as part of a group can be deactivated by removing this user from the group in Microsoft Entra ID.  

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not part of the organization, clicking on more options button in the search results will only provide the option to add this user to the organization. 

### Delete a member from the organization: 

- Search for the user from the search field in the members’ page 

- Select on the more options button next to the user in the search results. Select on Delete. 

    - Deleting a user from the organization removes their user record from the organization database.  

    - If the user is added again to Viva Goals either individually or via a group, then the system creates a new user record for this user. This user record is delinked from the old user record.  

- It's recommended that the delete member feature is only used when a member has left the company altogether.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If the user is not part of the organization, clicking on more options button in the search results will only provide the option to add this user to the organization.
