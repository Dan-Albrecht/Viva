# Where to find digest email insights

In March of 2024, we paused all types of digest emails, including individual contributor, manager, and welcome emails, which were typically sent twice a month. However, all the content from digest emails is still available elsewhere within the [Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/viva-insights-app-in-teams-and-on-the-web-f07f80a1-177d-4541-9185-31493b74fc0f). You can continue to explore and analyze your data insights seamlessly. Here's where to find the insights.
