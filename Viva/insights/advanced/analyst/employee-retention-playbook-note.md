# Playbook End Note

We hope this playbook provides a useful guide for analysts who are interested in building an Employee Retention Model using Viva Insights and Glint data.

By carefully selecting relevant predictors, addressing collinearity, and using appropriate techniques and algorithms, you can build an accurate and reliable model that can help your organization retain their valuable employees. We encourage analysts to continue exploring and refining their models, and to [share their insights and experiences with the community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-insights/ct-p/VivaInsights).

Thank you to all the contributors who helped make this playbook possible.
