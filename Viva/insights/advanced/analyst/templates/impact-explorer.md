# Impact explorer report

Using a template populated by Microsoft Viva Insights, the **Impact explorer** report estimates how taking actions facilitated by Viva Insights can positively impact your organization.

>[!Note]
>This report provides impact estimates for several different scenarios. Depending on the page and topic, "impact" can refer to how employee hours or employees would be affected by taking certain actions. For example, the impact of reducing recurring long and large meetings could be 23,000 employee hours.


With this report, you can:

* Explore potential opportunities to:
    * Give employees back time from meetings.
    * Help employees stay productive during their non-meeting time.
* Estimate how taking actions might impact your organization. These estimates are based on default values, which you can customize for your organization.
* Track adoption progress for focus time kept by employees in Viva Insights.

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Impact explorer** query in Viva Insights.

|Setting| Description|
|-----|---------|
|**Select the time period to measure**|Set the time period that you want to analyze—for example, 3/10/2022 – 9/10/2022.|
|**Select an organizational attribute to view the report by**|Set the primary group-by attribute shown in all subsequent reports. You can change this attribute at any time and all subsequent report pages will group values by the new attribute.|
|**Select optional filters to exclude employee groups**|Filter the measured employee population by selecting organizational attributes—for example, “Region”—and then selecting values for those attributes—for example, "Pacific."<br><br>When you use filters, the **Measured employees** count on the page’s top right will show a reduced number.|
|**Average employee hourly rate**|Enter the average hourly rate for your employees. The report’s default rate is 75. To adjust the value, type in the average hourly rate in your organization or locate the number by moving the slicer. <br><br> What you enter here affects how the **Overview** page estimates the monetary worth of repurposed employee time.|
|**Exclude weeks marked with a holiday indicator**|Select this control to exclude unusually low collaboration weeks based on individual collaboration patterns. These low collaboration weeks usually occur when employees are taking time off from work.|
|**Exclude non-knowledge workers**|Select this control to exclude employees who spend a weekly average of no more than five hours in meetings, emails, chats, and calls. These employees are unlikely to be knowledge workers or they don’t use Outlook or Teams.|
|**Select the preferred language for your report**|Pick your report’s language.|

### About default values in Identify opportunities sections

In each of the following pages’ **Identify opportunities** sections, you’ll find default values within dropdown menus: 

* **Give employees time back from meetings**
* **Protect employee non-meeting time**
* **Foster an engaged workforce**

The report uses these values to make its estimates.
 
To more accurately reflect your organization, you can change these values. After you make changes, the report refreshes its estimate calculations. Refer to About the report for more details on adjusting these default values for each page.

## About the report

>[!Note] 
>The estimates presented in this report are base estimates to help you start identifying and evaluating opportunities in your organization. These values aren’t a product promise or a full coverage of the product value.

### Overview

Based on the **Impact areas** in the table below, the **Overview** page gives three estimates near the top of the page:

* **Employee time that could be repurposed** – The total number of employee hours that could be repurposed if your organization did two things through Viva Insights: 
    * Gave time back from meetings. We define this as shortening meetings and reducing long and large recurring meetings by half.
    * Protected employee non-meeting time. We define this as using focus time, taking time to learn a new skill, or taking a break at lunch.
* **Estimated weekly potential impact per employee** – This value is **Employee time that could be repurposed** averaged per week, per employee. Use this estimate to find out how an average employee might benefit from using Viva Insights each week.
* **Estimated worth of employee time that could be repurposed** – This value is the employee time that could be repurposed multiplied by the average employee hourly rate. To change hourly rates, go to the **Settings** page.

#### Potential impact by impact area and actions

For each of the following four actions, this table shows you the potential impact in hours and weekly impact per employee:

* Shorten meetings 
* Optimize recurring long and large meetings
* Protect time to focus
* Schedule learning time and lunch breaks

Use this table to:

* Find the total potential impact of an action item.
* Find the weekly per-person impact for each action item. 
* Identify and prioritize high-impact opportunities for your organization.

#### Top groups by potential impact

View how groups in your organization could most benefit from taking all actions listed in the table to the left. 

To view the top groups that could benefit from taking a particular action, select an action—like **Shorten meetings**—on the **Potential impact by impact area and actions** table. You’ll get an impact estimate for groups in your organization based on that action only.

### Give employees time back from meetings

Get an estimate of the hours employees could get back from meetings if your organization did two things through Viva Insights:

* Shortened meetings.
    * Your organization can shorten meetings automatically through a [shared meeting plan](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/shared-meeting-plan-in-viva-insights-30c3d08b-5761-4ff7-ba7d-32d9f00759a4).
* Reduced recurring long and large meetings.
    * To find out which recurring meetings might be good candidates to reduce, your organization can use the [Recurring meeting audit Power BI template](recurring-meeting.md).  

#### Understand the baseline 

View the:

* Weekly average hours spent in meetings per employee. 
* Time spent in 30-60 minutes meetings and longer ones.

#### Identify opportunities 

Get an estimate of the hours employees could get back from meetings if your organization rolled out the shorten meeting solution, which is part of the shared meeting plan. To view how many employees could benefit from this solution, select the **Employees** button. 

The report calculates this estimate using the default values beneath the bar graph. These values represent the number of minutes each meeting would be automatically shortened by if your organization used the shorten meeting solution. To change these numbers and update the estimates, use the dropdown menus. 

>[!Note]
>The numbers in this visual are a base estimate according to employee meeting behaviors during this report's selected time period.

#### Take action 

Select:

* **Try it for your team** to start a shared meeting plan with your reports. 
* **Try it for yourself** to automatically shorten the meetings *you* schedule.
* **Learn more** to access online documentation for the shared meeting plan.

#### Reclaim more employee time

Get an estimate of how much time employees could save if your organization made recurring long and large meetings half as long. You can review and audit the recurring meetings through the **Recurring meeting audit** Power BI report.
 
>[!Note]
>**Large and long meeting hours** are meeting hours with a duration of more than one hour and nine or more invitees, including the organizer.

### Protect employee non-meeting time

Get an estimate of the hours employees could use to focus on individual tasks, develop career skills, or take lunch breaks.

#### Understand the baseline 

Identify how much unscheduled time is available per week, per employee. Unscheduled time is the number of working hours that aren’t:

* Occupied by meetings.
* Scheduled as focus time through Viva Insights. 

Employees could protect some of this unscheduled time for productive use, like focusing on high-priority tasks or learning a new skill.

#### Identify opportunities 

Get an estimate of the number of hours employees could reserve as focus time in Viva Insights. The report bases this calculation on the default value beneath the bar graph. Like on other pages, you can change the value here to better fit your organization. 

When it makes this estimate calculation, the report considers how employees are already using focus time in Viva Insights. Let’s say someone kept one hour of focus time each day during the report’s selected time period. However, the preferred amount is two hours, as indicated in the default value beneath the bar graph. When it makes this opportunity calculation, the report will capture the remaining one hour this employee could use for focus time. 

Select the **Employee** button for an estimate of the number of employees who could benefit from more focus time in Viva Insights. 

#### Take action 

Select:

* **Set up shared focus plan** to start a focus plan with your team.
* **Set up focus plan for yourself** to start a personal focus plan.
* **Track progress for focus time** to jump to this other page in the report.
* **Learn more** to access our online documentation about shared focus plans.

#### More ways to protect time

Get an estimate of the time employees could protect to learn a skill or to connect with friends or colleagues at lunch.

### Foster an engaged workforce

Find opportunities to empower employees and keep them engaged through regular manager 1:1s and discover tools that can protect their time after work.

#### Understand the baseline 

Identify how much time each employee spends with their manager in recurring 1:1 conversations every four weeks. 

#### Identify opportunities 

Get an estimate of the number of employees who could benefit from connecting more regularly with their managers. The report bases this calculation on the default value beneath the bar graph—that is, the number of minutes employees spend with their manager every four weeks. Like on other pages, you can change the value here to better fit your organization. 

Select the **Hours** button to view the estimated time your organization could invest in empowering employees.

#### Take action 

Select **Learn more** to access our team insights documentation, which explains how to use the Viva Insights app in Teams to keep up with your direct reports.

#### Protect employee time after work 

Get an estimate of the hours employees spend asynchronously collaborating after work—like sending emails and Teams chats—that they could shift to their working hours.

### Track progress for focus time kept by employees

Find out how your organization is adopting focus time in Viva Insights, including the impact of booking and keeping that focus time. While earlier report pages focus on the potential value of focus time, this page helps show the value that focus time is already bringing to your organization.

>[!Note]
> “Kept focus time” means that an employee booked focus time in Viva Insights that didn’t overlap with their meetings, and they didn’t later delete that focus time from their calendar. This time includes time booked with and without a focus plan.

#### Focus time kept
