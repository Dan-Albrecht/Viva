# Onboarding and development report

The **Onboarding and development** report helps leaders understand the onboarding experience of new hires and/or employees who've started out in a new role within the company. The report also identifies opportunities to improve the onboarding experience and structure development. 

Because research shows it typically takes new employees 12 months to reach their full performance potential, this report focuses on the entire period a new hire is learning, connecting, and developing in their new role. Additionally, you can customize the definition of new hire to best fit your organization: whether it includes employees who recently joined the company or also employees who recently started out in a new role. You can also customize the number of months the new hire should be in the new role.

This report has three sections, which each address different facets of the onboarding experience for new hires and those new in the role. These sections help you answer the following business questions: 

* **Coach with manager 1:1s**
    * Are new hires getting the 1:1 coaching and support from their managers that they need? 
* **Boost time spent learning** 
    * Is the organization sufficiently encouraging new hires and employees to set aside time for learning?
* **Foster new hire networks** 
    * How are new hires developing their network and how fast are they integrating into the organization’s network?

Key metrics provide a deep-dive into each topic, along with a **Why it matters** interpretation and recommended actions. 

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Onboarding and development** query in Viva Insights.

* Have the **HireDate** attribute, which indicates when a person was hired, uploaded as part of your organizational data.

>[!Note]
>If you want your report to include new hires and existing employees who've transferred to a new role, you'll also need to include the **RoleStartDate** attribute, which indicates when a person started in a new role or function. Without **RoleStartDate**, however, the rest of the report will still load. 
>
>You can add new attributes to your organizational data at any time. For more details on how to add new data for existing employees, refer to [subsequent uploads](../../admin/upload-org-data-subsequent.md).
