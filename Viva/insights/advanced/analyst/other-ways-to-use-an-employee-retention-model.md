# Other ways to use an Employee Retention Model

To retain your employees, you can use a retention model in a few other key ways:

1. **Develop targeted retention strategies**: If the model identifies that a particular employee segment has a high attrition rate, you can develop targeted strategies that are relevant to that particular segment to improve employee retention.

2. **Measure the effectiveness of retention strategies**: Organizations with specific retention initiatives and strategies can utilize an employee retention model to measure the effectiveness of those strategies and track changes over time.

3. **Predict future attrition**: An employee retention model can use historical data to predict future turnover rates. This can help organizations plan for future staffing needs, helping them reduce costs.

While it's important to retain employees and minimize employee turnover, having too little attrition can also be problematic. The goal of employee attrition and retention is to strike the right balance of holding on to top talent while accepting that some level of attrition is necessary to prevent lack of motivation setting in and injecting the organization with fresh perspectives and ideas.

Context becomes critical when developing targeted strategies to retain employees. Not every organization and not every job is suitable for every person. If an employee who is not a good fit or is underperforming leaves, there is an opportunity to fill the role with a high performer who is a better fit.

In addition, understanding which positions within the company are transitional or temporary roles, and whether high or low performers are leaving, can provide clarity in interpreting attrition rates and deciding how to move forward with retention initiatives.
