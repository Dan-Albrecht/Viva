# Customize your Viva Engage community

In Viva Engage, you can brand your community with cover photos. Cover photos help create a richer identity and better reflect the purpose of your community.

This customization experience is available for community admins on the web and mobile devices. On the community page, users can see the new cover photos in the header. As a community admin (or a verified network admin), you can upload a cover photo for your group.

## To upload a web cover photo

1. In the community header, select **Upload Cover Photo**.
2. From the file list, select an image to upload.

   The file must be 20 MBs or less and in PNG, JPEG, or nonanimated GIF format. Dimensions for web cover photos are 680 x 275 pixels.
