# Set up Viva Engage

To set up Microsoft Viva Engage, you must have Microsoft 365 Global administrator or Engage administrator permissions.

## Set up licensing for Viva Engage

**Core experience**

As a foundational component of Microsoft Viva Engage, the Core Service Plan provides essential features and capabilities to enhance engagement and collaboration within your organization.

- **If you *don't* enforce Viva Engage licensing**, users can access the Viva Engage Core experience.<br>
- **If you *do* enforce Viva Engage licensing**, users can still access the Viva Engage Core experience. However, each user must be assigned:<br>

    - a Microsoft 365 license, *and*
    - a Viva Engage Core Service Plan (or Yammer Enterprise Service Plan)

**Premium experience**

 Your organization can enjoy premium Viva Engage experiences if your tenant owns either of these plans:

- Microsoft Viva Suite
- Microsoft Viva Employee Communications and Communities

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators do not need a premium Viva Engage license to configure premium Viva Engage and Answers experiences. Learn more about [managing licenses in Microsoft 365](/Viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365).

|Service plan |Enables |Comes with this product |

## Configure and review privacy and security settings

The Engage administrator (Yammer administrator) can manage Viva Engage content and security settings.
For details, see [Overview of security & compliance for Viva Engage](/viva/engage/manage-security-and-compliance/security-and-compliance).

## Set up Viva Engage

Where you set up Viva Engage is a matter of preference. Global and Engage admins (Yammer administrators in Microsoft Entra ID) can use the Microsoft 365 admin center for initial setup. The Engage admin center provides most Viva Engage settings and customization options.

From the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can:

- Assign [Engage and Answers admins](eac-key-admin-roles-permissions.md)
- Pin Viva Engage in Teams
- Manage other settings in Viva Engage

## Install Viva Engage

### Install Viva Engage in Teams

1. Open Teams on the web or in a desktop client.

2. From the left side of Teams, select **Apps**.

3. Search for Viva Engage.
