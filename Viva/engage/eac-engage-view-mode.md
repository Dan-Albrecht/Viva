# Manage user privileges with view-only mode in Viva Engage (Private Preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>View-only mode for Viva Engage is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change.

Microsoft 365 Global admins and Engage admins can use view-only mode to prevent a Viva Engage user from contributing content.

## User experience in view-only mode

In view-only mode, an information banner appears at the top of the Viva Engage experience, and publisher and creation features are unavailable. Users assigned to view-only mode can continue to follow others, receive and manage notifications, view analytics, report conversations, and bookmark threads. Users can also view announcements and browse content in any Viva Engage app (desktop, web, mobile, Teams, Outlook, or SharePoint).

## Limitations of view-only mode

When a user is in view-only mode, they have **no access** to the following features:

>[!NOTE]
>The limitations stated here apply throughout the Viva Engage app on all surfaces (desktop, web, mobile, Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint).

- Creation of new posts, comments, or replies to posts

- Editing capability on existing posts, comments, or replies

- Content sharing between storylines or communities (public or private)

## Manage users in view-only mode

Admins can set view-only mode from the Engage admin center. This control works by assigning specific users to view-only mode. Once assigned, a user remains in view-only mode until removed at the admin's discretion. Engage admins can add or remove view-only mode for a user at any time.

**To assign a user to view-only mode:**

1. Go to the [Viva Engage admin center](/viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).

2. From the **Governance and compliance tab**, select the **View-only mode** option.

3. Select **Add a user**.

4. Use the search function to find and select the user name you want, and then confirm your selection.<br>

    The user's name appears in the list of users in view-only mode with the date the status was applied and the admin who applied the status.

**To unassign a user from view-only mode:**

- In the **View-only mode** list, select the trash icon next to the user's name.
