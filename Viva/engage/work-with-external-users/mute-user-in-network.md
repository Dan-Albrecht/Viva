# Remove a user's posts from Viva Engage feeds (Private Preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Viva Engage Mute user for network option is currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change.

The **mute user for network** option lets Engage admins and network admins remove a user’s thread starters from the Home feed and storylines feed, and from future email digests. A *thread starter* is defined as the original post (question, conversation, article, poll, or praise) that a user publishes in Viva Engage.

Muting a user for the network doesn’t hide the user’s content from communities or storylines or prevent the user from creating content. Muting simply reduces the user’s visibility by removing thread starters from discovery surfaces.

## How does the user’s experience change?

When a user’s account is in mute status, the user receives no notification of this change. Any thread starters they’ve posted are removed from the Home feed, storylines feed, and email digests. Comments and replies they’ve posted show in these locations.

Followers of the muted user’s account continue to get notifications of the muted user’s posts and see their thread starters in the Home feed, storylines feed, and email digests. All other users (non-followers) can only see a muted user’s content by visiting the muted user’s storyline or the communities they belong to.

### Assign muted status to a user account

Engage admins and network admins can assign specific users to the mute status in the Engage admin center. The user account remains in mute status until it’s removed by an admin.

1. Go to the Viva Engage admin center.

2. From the **Governance and compliance** tab, select **Manage users**.

3. Select Mute user.

4. Select Add a user.

5. Use the search function to find and select the username you want, and then confirm your selection.

The user's name appears in a muted users list with a date stamp and your name (the admin who applied the mute status).

### Unassign mute status to a user account

In the muted users list, select the trash icon next to the user's name.

### Track activity in the Microsoft 365 user audit log

All activity from the mute user for network mode feature is available through the user audit logs, including:

- User ID of each user who is muted
- User ID of admins who assigned or unassigned mute status in the network
- Date and time the user was muted for the network or the mute status was removed
