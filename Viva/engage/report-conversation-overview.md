# Report a Viva Engage conversation

Viva Engage admins can empower users across the network to report conversations and comments that don't follow organizational guidelines or policies. An admin can turn on the **Report conversations** option in the Viva Engage admin center to set this up. The options in the admin center change, however, depending on whether you have a license that includes Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance:

- **Licenses that don't include communication compliance**. If you don't have a license that includes communication compliance, when the option is turned on, the Viva Engage admin can specify an email address to receive reported conversations. The admin can also enter pre-submission instructions and post-submission confirmations for the user as described in this article. 

- **Licenses that do include communication compliance**. If you do have a license that includes communication compliance, when the option is turned on, any reported conversations are automatically routed through communication compliance for investigation and remediation.

4. After you enable conversations, enter information for the following two settings:

    - **Report recipient (an organization email address)** - Provide an organization email address where reports are sent. Viva Engage can't verify that the email address you enter is an organization email address.  

    - **Pre-submission details or instructions for user** – Provide messaging that explains the reporting process to users when they select **Report a Conversation**.  

For example, explain who in your organization their report goes to and next steps in the process. If possible, provide a link to your company network usage guidelines. Limited to 1,500 characters.

5. Optionally, use the **Post-submission instructions to user** setting to explain to your employees what happens after they submit a report. For example, set expectations for when the submitter can expect a response and next steps for the organization. Limited to 1,500 characters.

Users can find a right-panel pop-out with a custom message from the Engage admin and a required **Reason for Reporting** box.

The reported conversation or comment, the user who reports the comment, and their reason for reporting, is sent to the email address that's specified in the **Report Conversations** settings.

Upon successful submission, the user sees the optional custom message configured by the admin. They also receive a confirmation message that includes their report and a link to the reported conversation, comment, or reply.

### Email reports

When a report is submitted, email is sent to the organization email address set for **Report Conversations** in the admin settings. It includes the following information:

- The name of the person who submitted the report.
- Whether a conversation starter or comment is being reported. The title and text of the email indicates whether a conversation starter or comment is being reported.
- The name of the person who started the conversation or wrote the comment being reported.
- The community in which the reported conversation or comment was made.
- The date and time at which the reported conversation or comment was made.
- A link to the specific conversation starter.
- Any comments entered by the reporting user.

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Engage doesn't currently support deep links to comments. In the report emails for both conversation starters and comments, the link that's reported is always the conversation starter link. Reports don't contain deep links to a reported comment. The report reviewer can use the conversation starter link together with the reported comment timestamp to find the actual reported comment in the conversation.

A copy of this email is also sent to the Viva Engage user who submitted the report.
