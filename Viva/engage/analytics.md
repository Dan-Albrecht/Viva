Analytics data is refreshed every 24 hours. If you don’t see changes reflected immediately, check back the next day.

## Network analytics

>[!NOTE] 
>For the **Network analytics** dashboard to be available, at least 50% of the network’s users must be licensed for Viva Suite or Employee Communications and Communities.

Network analytics provide valuable insights into employee engagement and communication across your organization. With the ability to track sentiment, retention, and community activity, network admins and corporate communicators can make informed decisions and take targeted actions to improve the overall health of their network.

*Employee retention* shows the difference in the 28-day employee retention rates of employees who do and don't use Viva Engage. For details, see [Employee Retention](/purview/retention-policies-viva-engage).

## Audience analytics  

>[!NOTE]
>Audience analytics are only viewable by leaders who have at least one primary assigned audience (minumum audience size of 5) and their delegates.

In the **Manage analytics** interface shown earlier, the Engage admin can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that's available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience analytics** dashboard. This functionality enables unique levels of sentiment collection at the audience, theme, or conversation level.

Access is through the analytics icon on the top navigation bar or on the leader's storyline page.

*Audience analytics* help leaders and delegates monitor engagement of their audiences on Viva Engage. This dashboard surfaces the most actively engaged communities within their audiences that have at least 50 members and one active member. A community is considered active if at least 5% of its members have reacted or replied to posts, while a community is considered idle if less than 5% of its members have engaged in this way.

*Sentiment and theme analysis* uses Azure Cognitive Services (ACS) to aggregate and analyze posts and comments from storylines and public posts. Private community posts and comments are included in the aggregate if the leader is a member of a private community (that is, the leader has permission to view private posts). Individual messages are never shown. Learn more about [Sentiment analysis in Viva Engage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sentiment-and-theme-analysis-in-viva-engage-065c3355-d156-4bf8-afdb-663b0724befd).

- **Audience-level sentiment** controls the *Sentiment* metric. When this toggle is turned off, leaders and their delegates have no access to sentiment analysis features and past data for all audiences is deleted.

-   **Theme-level sentiment** controls the *Themes* metric. When this toggle is turned off, leaders and their delegates won’t see results indicating sentiment toward frequently discussed subjects in their audience.

## Global Answers analytics

Engage admins who have the knowledge license can manage metrics for **Answers** in their organization.

## Campaign analytics  

Engage admins and corporate communicators have access to analytics to monitor campaign engagement to improve future campaigns. You can access campaign analytics from the **Campaign management** dashboard, the campaign landing page, or the analytics icon on the main navigation menu of Viva Engage.
