# Set up Microsoft Viva Topics

You can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to set up and configure [Topics](topic-experiences-overview.md).

It is important to plan the best way to set up and configure topics in your environment. Be sure to read [Plan for Microsoft Viva Topics](plan-topic-experiences.md) before you begin the procedures in this article.

You must be [subscribed to Viva Topics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics) and be a global administrator, or both SharePoint administrator and groups administrator to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up Topics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have configured SharePoint to [require managed devices](/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices), you must set up Topics from a managed device.

## Assign licenses

You must assign licenses for the users who will be using Topics. Only users with a license can see information on topics including highlights, topic cards, topic pages and the topic center.

To assign licenses:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Users**, click **Active users**.

2. Select the users that you want to license, and click **Licenses and apps**.

3. Under **Licenses**, select **Viva Topics**.

4. Under **Apps**, make sure **Graph Connectors Search with Index (Viva Topics)** and **Viva Topics** are both selected.

5. Click **Save changes**.

It may take up to an hour for users to get access to Topics after the licenses are assigned.

Note that users must also have an Exchange Online license to use Topics.

## Set up Topics

> [!NOTE]
> The first time topic discovery is enabled, it may take up to two weeks for all suggested topics to appear in the Manage Topics view. Topic discovery continues as new content or updates to content are made. It is normal to have fluctuations in the number of suggested topics in your organization as Viva Topics evaluates new information.

To set up Topics:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), select **Setup**, and then choose **Microsoft Viva**.

   ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Viva setup card.](../media/viva-setup.png)

2. Select **Viva Topics**.

   [![Screenshot of the Viva admin page.](../media/viva-new-admin.png)](../media/viva-new-admin.png#lightbox)

3. This will take you to the Viva Topics admin page. Choose **Set up Viva Topics** to set up how topics will work for your organization.

### Topic discovery

On the Topic discovery page, you'll choose how Viva Topics sources and identifies topics.

1. In the **Select SharePoint topic sources** section, select which SharePoint sites will be crawled as sources for your topics during discovery. Choose from:
    - **All sites**: All SharePoint sites in your organization. This includes current and future sites.
    - **All, except selected sites**: Type the names of the sites you want to exclude.  You can also upload a list of sites that you want to opt out from discovery. Sites created in future will be included as sources for topic discovery.
    - **Only selected sites**: Type the names of the sites you want to include. You can also upload a list of sites. Sites created in the future will not be included as sources for topic discovery.
    - **No sites**: Do not include any SharePoint sites.

2. Select **Save**.

3. In the **Select data connection sources** section, choose any additional sources you want Viva Topics to source topics from. [Learn more about eligible connection sources](/microsoft-365/knowledge/manage-topics).

4. In the **Exclude topics by name** section, you can add names of topics you want to exclude from topic discovery. Use this setting to prevent sensitive information from being included as topics. The options are:
    - **Don't exclude any topics**
    - **Exclude topics by name**
      1. To exclude topics by name, download and fill out the CSV file with the topics you want excluded.
      1. In the CSV template, enter the following information about the topics you want to exclude:
         - **Name**: Type the name of the topic you want to exclude. There are two ways to do this:
            - Exact match: You can include the exact name or acronym (for example, *Contoso* or *ATL*).
            - Partial match: You can exclude all topics that have a specific word in it.  For example, *arc* will exclude all topics with the word *arc* in it, such as *Arc circle*, *Plasma arc welding*, or *Training arc*. Note that it will not exclude topics in which the text is included as part of a word, such as *Architecture*.
         - **Stands for (optional)**: If you want to exclude an acronym, type the words the acronym stands for.
         - **MatchType-Exact/Partial**: Type whether the name you entered was an *exact* or *partial* match type.
      1. Upload your completed file and choose **Save**.

### Topic visibility

On the **Topic visibility** page, you'll choose who can see topics.

> [!NOTE]
> While this setting allows you to select any user in your organization, only users who have Topic Experiences licenses assigned to them are able to view topics.

1. Choose **Edit** to make changes to who can see topics.

2. Select one of the following options:
    - **Everyone in my organization**
    - **Only selected people or security groups**
    - **No one**

    ![Screenshot of the who can see topics options.](../media/knowledge-management/ksetup2.png)

3. Select **Save**.

### Topic permissions

>[!NOTE]
>If you update user roles and permissions, these changes can take over an hour to take effect.

In the **Topic permissions** page, you choose who can create, edit, and manage topics.

![Screenshot of the topic permissions page.](../media/knowledge-management/topic-permissions.png)

1. First, go to the **Who can create and edit topics** section. You can select:
    - **Everyone in my organization**
    - **Only selected people or security groups**
    - **No one**

2. Select **Save**.

3. Then, go to the **Who can manage topics** section. You can select:
    - **Everyone in my organization**
    - **Only selected people or security groups**

4. Select **Save**.

5. If you chose **Only selected people or security groups**, type the name of the person or group and then select it when it appears. Repeat until you've added everyone who should be able to manage topics.

6. Select **Save**.

### Topic center

On the **Topic center** page, you can create your topic center site where users can view topic pages and manage topics.

![Screenshot of the Topic center page.](../media/knowledge-management/manage-topic-center.png)

1. Under **Topic center name**, choose **Edit**.

2. Pick a name for your topic center. Then select **Save**.

3. Next go to the **Site address** section. Here you can determine the URL of your topic center. Select **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can change the site name later, but you can't change the URL after you complete the wizard.

### Review and finish

Once you've chosen all your settings you can close out the **Manage Viva Topics** pane. You can change your settings at any time by repeating the same process from your Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Access to EWS Exchange

If your organization has controlled access to EWS Exchange, this will impact the Viva Topics product. Add "VivaTopicsApi" as the user agent string in EWSAllowList.

Control access to EWS for your organization:

## Manage topic experiences

Once you have set up Topics, you can change the settings that you chose during setup in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal#/featureexplorer/csi/KnowledgeManagement). Manage other areas in topics:
